2
00:02:08,274 --> 00:02:09,874
Oh, shit.

3
00:02:12,274 --> 00:02:13,741
I bet you 100 I lose 'em.

4
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,938
- That's 100 bucks you owe me.
- What?

5
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,874
Your silence was your bet.
You know that, right?

6
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:53,108
Shit.

7
00:03:00,107 --> 00:03:01,141
Step out of the car.

8
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,742
Step out of the car!

9
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:05,972
- Show me your hands. Hands!
- My hands are right here.

10
00:03:05,974 --> 00:03:08,039
- Step away!
- We on our way to the hosp...

11
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,771
Listen to... Listen to me.

12
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,606
- Stop resisting.
- Nobody's resisting you.

13
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,539
Get out of the car.

14
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,605
- Put your hands up and get out of the car.
- He can't!

15
00:03:15,607 --> 00:03:18,141
Why don't you open your eyes?
Go look at the tags.

16
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,939
What you think's keepin' him
sitting there so pretty?

17
00:03:20,941 --> 00:03:22,938
There's a chair, Sarge.

18
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,109
Good job, Columbo.

19
00:03:24,374 --> 00:03:25,905
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

20
00:03:25,907 --> 00:03:27,409
He's a quadriplegic.

21
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:31,275
We on our way to the hospital.
The man is havin' a seizure.

22
00:03:32,774 --> 00:03:34,439
Oh, Christ.

23
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:36,472
Y'all go ahead and take
your sweet time though.

24
00:03:36,474 --> 00:03:38,872
He's probably got a few minutes
before the rigoletto sets in.

25
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:39,808
Rigor mortis.

26
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:41,641
It's rigoletto.

27
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,575
Quads are already paralyzed,
so it's a special term.

28
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,239
Are y'all seriously
still standing there?

29
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:48,276
Check him out.

30
00:03:55,307 --> 00:03:57,373
We got a problem, guys.

31
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,038
You'll have a bigger problem if
I don't get him to the hospital.

32
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,571
Call an ambulance.

33
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,908
You think an ambulance
is faster than this car?

34
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:06,275
Boom! Huh?

35
00:04:06,907 --> 00:04:07,908
Jesus.

36
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:09,742
You really sold that one,
didn't you?

37
00:04:14,641 --> 00:04:15,705
"Rigoletto"?

38
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,571
All right.
So, we radioed ahead.

39
00:04:27,573 --> 00:04:29,238
They're comin' out
with a gurney.

40
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,474
- All right?
- Okay.

41
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:32,105
He's gonna be fine.

42
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:33,275
Appreciate you, man.

43
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:42,707
What now?

44
00:05:03,407 --> 00:05:04,441
Just over there.

45
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,142
Such a waste of time.

46
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:10,707
All of this.

47
00:05:13,308 --> 00:05:14,742
What was I supposed to do?

48
00:05:15,907 --> 00:05:17,041
You couldn't breathe.

49
00:05:17,808 --> 00:05:21,376
Yvonne, I said
no extraordinary measures.

50
00:05:21,607 --> 00:05:23,475
Repeatedly.

51
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:35,475
Where are the signatures?

52
00:05:36,474 --> 00:05:37,875
I've been looking, trust me.

53
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,472
I'm not paid to trust you.

54
00:05:39,474 --> 00:05:40,874
Do you wanna
go back to prison?

55
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,871
I didn't belong in prison.

56
00:05:42,873 --> 00:05:44,772
You need to prove
you're looking for work.

57
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:45,708
I am.

58
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:47,772
It's just that the leads
that the computer

59
00:05:47,774 --> 00:05:49,638
keeps choosin' for me,
they not for me.

60
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,141
The computer don't know me.

61
00:05:51,774 --> 00:05:53,206
You don't know me.

62
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,772
Well, I know you, Mr. Scott,

63
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:56,871
and you need three signatures
by tomorrow,

64
00:05:56,873 --> 00:05:58,276
or you can tell it
to the judge.

65
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:04,606
What does great
customer service mean to you?

66
00:06:04,608 --> 00:06:07,238
Doin' the right thing.
I don't know.

67
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,706
Tell me about a time when you
worked hard to solve a problem.

68
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,375
This morning, gettin' up.

69
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:14,607
Do you even want to work here?

70
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,209
I just need a signature.

71
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,541
Don't give up.

72
00:06:32,307 --> 00:06:33,439
Like this?

73
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:34,707
Yeah, that should do it.

74
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:38,875
Why is my cook
and her husband doing this?

75
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:43,042
Because you fired David.

76
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,205
But we have some great resumes
for life auxiliaries,

77
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,308
and we're gonna
find you someone.

78
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:51,109
Someone you like.

79
00:07:08,873 --> 00:07:10,908
I have an interview
with a Mr. LaCasse.

80
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,408
Same.

81
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:16,708
The first elevator.

82
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,574
I'll send it up for you.

83
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:28,075
Wait, this thing goin' up?

84
00:07:29,573 --> 00:07:31,142
You here for the cleaning gig?

85
00:07:31,807 --> 00:07:33,608
Uh, life auxiliary.

86
00:07:34,607 --> 00:07:35,705
Life what?

87
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:36,807
Auxiliary.

88
00:07:37,141 --> 00:07:40,372
That's what they
callin' it now?

89
00:07:40,374 --> 00:07:42,408
White people got a name
for everything.

90
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:44,974
Penthouse?

91
00:07:48,273 --> 00:07:49,474
This is an apartment?

92
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:18,440
Yo.

93
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,807
Are you asking me
to move over?

94
00:08:23,107 --> 00:08:24,307
Except I'm not asking.

95
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:26,108
Just move, man.

96
00:08:33,574 --> 00:08:35,742
Ain't this gig supposed to be
for the whole building?

97
00:08:36,374 --> 00:08:38,307
No, just for him, Mr. LaCasse.

98
00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:45,207
You gotta put on your Sunday
clothes just to push his broom?

99
00:08:50,941 --> 00:08:51,909
So...

100
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,772
What would you
like to tell us?

101
00:08:54,774 --> 00:08:57,875
I take my relationship with
my clients very personally.

102
00:08:58,207 --> 00:08:59,939
And seriously, I mean...

103
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:02,905
And professionally as well,
of course.

104
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:05,608
I don't hear "disability."

105
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,375
I hear "this ability."

106
00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:14,271
Let me be your hands
and your arms and your legs.

107
00:09:14,273 --> 00:09:17,605
Allow the space
where you begin and I end

108
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:20,874
to be both infinite
and infinitesimal.

109
00:09:22,908 --> 00:09:24,475
I love that. You...

110
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,408
All right.

111
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:27,909
Your book changed me.

112
00:09:28,474 --> 00:09:31,642
So, I figured, even if
I don't get the position,

113
00:09:32,307 --> 00:09:33,775
I could get an autograph.

114
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:37,042
How would you
get an autograph?

115
00:10:45,073 --> 00:10:47,072
It's sort of
an interesting thought.

116
00:10:47,074 --> 00:10:49,772
The chair is a metaphor
for energy.

117
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,471
The way I look at it,
it's not what's been taken from you,

118
00:10:52,473 --> 00:10:54,906
it's what you've been given.

119
00:10:54,908 --> 00:10:57,806
I was with my previous client
for 18 years, so can't get rid of me.

120
00:10:57,808 --> 00:10:59,305
Well,
I have kids of my own.

121
00:10:59,307 --> 00:11:01,974
So, washing? Check.
Feeding? Check.

122
00:11:02,406 --> 00:11:04,104
Spills and accidents?
Check, check.

123
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:05,439
I was a sociology major.

124
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:07,806
I gotta go get my kid, man.

125
00:11:07,808 --> 00:11:09,775
You can't always tell by looking
at someone what's wrong with them.

126
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:16,440
Now, tell me more about the previous...
Excuse me.

127
00:11:16,807 --> 00:11:19,305
- What are you doing?
- Oh, relax, it's not a holdup.

128
00:11:19,307 --> 00:11:22,471
I mean, even though you been holding
me up for damn near a hour out there.

129
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,806
I gotta get to my kid, yo.

130
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,105
You need to wait your turn.

131
00:11:25,107 --> 00:11:26,739
All I need is a John Hancock.

132
00:11:26,741 --> 00:11:28,375
Ain't gonna take you
but a second, lady.

133
00:11:29,074 --> 00:11:30,905
Are you delivering something?

134
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:33,705
Yeah, employment papers.
I just gotta have somebody sign it.

135
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:35,805
It's gotta be, like,
a manager or the owner.

136
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,807
Is that you?

137
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,141
Nah, it ain't you.
Is that you, boss?

138
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,107
Yes.

139
00:11:41,373 --> 00:11:43,104
Fantastic, man.
Just sign this for me, please.

140
00:11:43,106 --> 00:11:44,641
How would I sign it?

141
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,909
I don't know.

142
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,141
Slowly?

143
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,207
What? Don't your arms work?

144
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:55,974
- They don't.
- Damn.

145
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:57,872
What about you, sweetie?

146
00:11:57,874 --> 00:11:59,275
Why do you need a signature?

147
00:11:59,608 --> 00:12:02,375
I don't need a signature.
My PO needs a signature.

148
00:12:02,607 --> 00:12:05,038
As a matter of fact,

149
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,808
you should put your number down here
just in case she wanna phone or check in.

150
00:12:07,106 --> 00:12:09,438
That way, it look like I did
what I said I was gonna do.

151
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,238
And if she asks, just say an extremely
attractive candidate came in here,

152
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,074
but y'all weren't lookin'
for a supermodel.

153
00:12:15,873 --> 00:12:17,439
I'm sorry, who might phone?

154
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:18,606
My PO.

155
00:12:18,608 --> 00:12:20,641
- PO?
- His parole officer.

156
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,874
What's that look about?

157
00:12:23,273 --> 00:12:24,807
Don't judge me.
I ain't judged you.

158
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,973
Will you excuse us
for a moment, please?

159
00:12:31,206 --> 00:12:32,207
Thank you.

160
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:35,875
- I gotta get to my kid, man.
- Why don't you have a seat?

161
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:37,441
No, I'm good.

162
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:39,938
So, you need a signature.
You don't need a job?

163
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,137
I need both.

164
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:42,407
Well, then have a seat.

165
00:12:43,473 --> 00:12:44,375
Please.

166
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,772
Have you ever done
this kind of work before?

167
00:12:50,774 --> 00:12:53,641
I've done every kind of work
that you can do with a record.

168
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:54,973
What were you in for?

169
00:12:57,206 --> 00:12:58,971
You're not allowed to ask me
that question in an interview.

170
00:12:58,973 --> 00:13:01,240
- Says?
- Says the constitution.

171
00:13:03,973 --> 00:13:06,137
As a matter of fact,

172
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:07,807
now that you asked me that question,
you gotta offer me the job.

173
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:13,808
Okay.

174
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:16,575
"Okay"?

175
00:13:18,073 --> 00:13:20,539
Okay,
I'm offering you the position.

176
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,372
What?
Philip, what are you doing?

177
00:13:23,374 --> 00:13:24,974
I'm offering him the position.

178
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,775
So?

179
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,907
I don't wanna be
your janitor, man.

180
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:35,307
Janitor? No, no. We're...
We're hiring a life auxiliary.

181
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,571
A what? What... What is that?

182
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:39,738
He doesn't even know what
he's applying for, Philip.

183
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,040
I need assistance.

184
00:13:41,906 --> 00:13:45,207
My arms don't work,
as you so astutely noted.

185
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:46,742
Nor do my legs.

186
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,375
I can only move my neck.

187
00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:51,742
You can move your mouth.

188
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:53,707
As can you.

189
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:56,305
So, what's that mean?
I gotta...

190
00:13:56,307 --> 00:13:57,871
I gotta carry you around
or somethin'?

191
00:13:57,873 --> 00:13:59,870
You'd have to transfer me
to the chair,

192
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,040
to my bed, to the car.

193
00:14:02,573 --> 00:14:04,771
There would be some travel,
if that interests you.

194
00:14:04,773 --> 00:14:05,742
It don't.

195
00:14:06,274 --> 00:14:07,638
Travel enough as it is.

196
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,274
It took me a hour
just to get here.

197
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:12,241
Uh-huh.

198
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:14,474
Okay. Uh...

199
00:14:14,973 --> 00:14:17,441
Look, I think your plantation
is bananas.

200
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:19,870
But unfortunately, I don't
wanna be nobody's servant.

201
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:22,104
So, how 'bout you just
sign my paperwork,

202
00:14:22,106 --> 00:14:23,904
and I'll think about
your offer, okay?

203
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,638
Well, we can't sign papers

204
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,305
saying that you're looking
for work

205
00:14:27,307 --> 00:14:29,808
if you're going to turn down
the work I offered.

206
00:14:30,274 --> 00:14:32,742
All right, I know you can't,
but how about your boo?

207
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,908
My boo?

208
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:41,308
- Yvonne is not my... my boo.
- No.

209
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,205
Are you, Yvonne?
Are you my boo?

210
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:44,438
- No, I'm not your boo.
- No.

211
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,071
All right. So listen,

212
00:14:46,073 --> 00:14:47,707
why don't you take the night
and think it over?

213
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:50,574
Come back tomorrow morning
ready for work,

214
00:14:51,374 --> 00:14:52,771
or we'll sign the papers.

215
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:56,275
I won't show you out.

216
00:14:56,574 --> 00:14:57,441
Yeah.

217
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:58,806
Don't you get up.

218
00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:06,642
Philip.

219
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,404
Why are you doing this?

220
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:09,972
Because it's what I want.

221
00:15:09,974 --> 00:15:11,371
If you don't like
the candidates

222
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:12,639
that we've found already,

223
00:15:12,641 --> 00:15:14,238
then let's just keep looking.

224
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,072
I would be happy to assist

225
00:15:16,074 --> 00:15:18,475
- in finding the perfect...
- No, I don't want your assistance.

226
00:15:19,274 --> 00:15:21,072
You're a businesswoman,
not a nurse.

227
00:15:21,074 --> 00:15:22,241
I know what I am.

228
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:24,104
I know.

229
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:25,873
I know that you do.

230
00:15:26,574 --> 00:15:29,372
But I hired you to manage
my affairs, not to...

231
00:15:29,374 --> 00:15:30,873
Rush you to the hospital?

232
00:15:31,207 --> 00:15:33,475
That's what this is about,
isn't it?

233
00:15:33,773 --> 00:15:35,774
You shouldn't have been
put in that position.

234
00:15:49,974 --> 00:15:52,207
Hey. Anthony Scott.

235
00:15:52,773 --> 00:15:54,074
His mother picked him up.

236
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:55,574
Damn, man.

237
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,307
I said I'd pick Anthony up.

238
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,037
You say a lot of things, Dell,

239
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,806
but I ain't
heard from you in days.

240
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,274
- Hey.
- Come on.

241
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,073
What's up, man?

242
00:16:52,306 --> 00:16:53,774
Your mom
still making you do that?

243
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,374
I got you somethin'.

244
00:17:06,474 --> 00:17:07,541
It's for your birthday.

245
00:17:11,607 --> 00:17:12,907
Which birthday?

246
00:17:18,074 --> 00:17:19,108
I deserve that.

247
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:21,642
I hear you.

248
00:17:22,806 --> 00:17:24,806
But, I mean, it's still a gift, man.
What do you say?

249
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:31,107
Anthony.

250
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:33,575
I'm talking to you.

251
00:17:34,373 --> 00:17:35,240
Anthony.

252
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:50,108
What are you doin'?

253
00:17:50,773 --> 00:17:52,774
Sitting on the couch, Latrice.

254
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,637
Don't think you stayin' here.

255
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:58,804
It's for one night, I just got
kicked out my place...

256
00:17:58,806 --> 00:18:00,104
No.

257
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:01,638
- Latrice...
- Dell, go look for work,

258
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,271
or do whatever the hell it is
that you do.

259
00:18:03,273 --> 00:18:05,207
Okay. So, you're in
one of your moods, I see.

260
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,408
- Listen...
- You know what, Dell?

261
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:09,773
Get out.

262
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:12,205
- What?
- Get out.

263
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:14,605
How you gonna kick me out when I'm
the one who found you the place?

264
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:16,275
Yeah, and look at it.

265
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,771
This place, I pay for. Not you.

266
00:18:19,773 --> 00:18:24,372
You owe me...
us so much child support

267
00:18:24,374 --> 00:18:26,072
that the other thing
that you owe us

268
00:18:26,074 --> 00:18:28,441
is a thank you
for not reportin' you.

269
00:18:29,373 --> 00:18:31,073
I am done, Dell.

270
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,741
I can't. Out.

271
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:36,040
I don't wanna see you
and neither do Anthony.

272
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:38,870
That boy needs me.
He needs me to protect him,

273
00:18:38,872 --> 00:18:41,371
because people around here
eat boys like that for lunch.

274
00:18:41,373 --> 00:18:43,539
How you gonna protect him
if you ain't never here?

275
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,372
You're asking me to leave.

276
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,240
- Because I can't count on you.
- What do you want from me?

277
00:18:48,939 --> 00:18:49,806
Hmm?

278
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,474
Now?

279
00:18:53,873 --> 00:18:54,908
Nothin'.

280
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:57,475
What did I want from you?

281
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:01,408
Everything.

282
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,571
Help, support.

283
00:19:04,573 --> 00:19:06,439
- I support you, Latrice.
- How?

284
00:19:06,441 --> 00:19:08,041
- What do you mean, "How?"
- Where?

285
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,372
You never look out
for nobody but you, Dell.

286
00:19:11,374 --> 00:19:13,372
- That's not true.
- So, you take a good look at this

287
00:19:13,374 --> 00:19:15,471
falling apartment
you found us,

288
00:19:15,473 --> 00:19:19,771
and on your way out, you look at
that child I have raised by myself.

289
00:19:19,773 --> 00:19:22,741
You know what? You take a good,
hard look at these things,

290
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:25,641
- because you ain't gonna see 'em again.
- Yo, why don't you...

291
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:29,641
Goodbye, Dell.

292
00:19:31,107 --> 00:19:32,241
You serious right now?

293
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,207
Cool.

294
00:19:56,974 --> 00:19:58,541
Need a place to stay, yo?

295
00:19:59,706 --> 00:20:01,573
- Nah, I'm good.
- Yeah.

296
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,606
Should get back
in the game, man.

297
00:20:03,973 --> 00:20:05,040
I could use you.

298
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:06,974
Easy money.

299
00:20:09,073 --> 00:20:10,108
Nah, man.

300
00:20:11,273 --> 00:20:12,606
It was never easy.

301
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,041
Jenny.

302
00:20:59,973 --> 00:21:00,874
Jenny.

303
00:21:01,806 --> 00:21:02,737
Philip.

304
00:21:39,973 --> 00:21:41,140
Good morning, Mr. Scott.

305
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:42,573
Ain't it?

306
00:21:44,073 --> 00:21:45,374
I can sign your paperwork.

307
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:47,774
There's no need.
I'mma take the gig.

308
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,375
Wouldn't it be better
if I just signed your papers?

309
00:21:52,073 --> 00:21:53,972
You are not qualified
for this position.

310
00:21:53,974 --> 00:21:55,438
You have never done it before.

311
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,941
Look, does he want me or not?

312
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,041
Yes, he does.

313
00:22:02,274 --> 00:22:03,308
All right, so good.

314
00:22:04,607 --> 00:22:05,641
How much does it pay?

315
00:22:11,406 --> 00:22:12,304
That a month?

316
00:22:12,306 --> 00:22:13,373
Per week.

317
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,104
All right.
Well, I can live with that.

318
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:21,737
If you throw in a MetroCard.

319
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:22,706
Unlimited.

320
00:22:22,939 --> 00:22:24,538
A MetroCard?

321
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,971
I gotta get here, don't I?

322
00:22:25,973 --> 00:22:28,740
Mr. Scott,
this is a live-in position.

323
00:23:20,406 --> 00:23:21,304
Mr. Scott.

324
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,573
Mr. Scott.

325
00:23:41,139 --> 00:23:44,470
This monitor travels
with you at all times.

326
00:23:44,472 --> 00:23:48,640
You need to be available
to Mr. LaCasse 24/7.

327
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,439
Do you have any questions?

328
00:23:52,906 --> 00:23:54,907
Um... Yeah. Why you so angry?

329
00:23:56,273 --> 00:23:57,607
You'll know when I'm angry.

330
00:23:58,107 --> 00:23:58,974
I scare you?

331
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:00,938
Yes.

332
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,707
Yes, you do, Mr. Scott.

333
00:24:03,739 --> 00:24:05,641
But not for the reasons
you're implying.

334
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:09,208
As powerful
as Mr. LaCasse is...

335
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,774
he's a vulnerable man.

336
00:24:12,472 --> 00:24:15,641
So, does it scare me to think of him
in the wrong hands? Yes, it does.

337
00:24:16,207 --> 00:24:18,937
Well, he don't seem to think these
the wrong hands. He picked 'em.

338
00:24:18,939 --> 00:24:20,270
And why do you think
he picked you?

339
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:21,773
Because I'm
the best candidate.

340
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,474
Because you were
the worst candidate.

341
00:24:25,305 --> 00:24:26,774
By far.

342
00:24:27,073 --> 00:24:28,570
Let's just call this what it is.
It's a game.

343
00:24:28,572 --> 00:24:30,105
In this game,
you get three strikes.

344
00:24:30,107 --> 00:24:31,641
That's the agreement
I made with him.

345
00:24:31,973 --> 00:24:33,074
You know baseball?

346
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,774
- I do.
- So you my referee?

347
00:24:36,372 --> 00:24:37,207
Umpire.

348
00:24:37,807 --> 00:24:38,807
Just testing you.

349
00:24:39,873 --> 00:24:41,141
Yes, you are.

350
00:25:03,273 --> 00:25:06,437
Mr. LaCasse needs
to be transferred to his chair

351
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:07,373
for breakfast.

352
00:25:08,405 --> 00:25:10,374
- Do you want me to go pick him up?
- Yes.

353
00:25:10,707 --> 00:25:11,908
Yes, pick him up.

354
00:25:47,472 --> 00:25:49,107
The buckle! Buckle!

355
00:25:55,607 --> 00:25:57,040
You need to buckle him.

356
00:25:57,873 --> 00:26:01,908
This needs to be strapped
at all times.

357
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:12,139
And now
you feed him breakfast.

358
00:26:12,473 --> 00:26:13,541
Can you do that?

359
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:15,439
Yeah.

360
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,438
Philip, I need
to call the gallery.

361
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,641
Are you sure you're good?

362
00:26:20,074 --> 00:26:21,407
Yvonne, I'm fine.

363
00:26:25,807 --> 00:26:27,971
Alexa, lower music.

364
00:26:30,074 --> 00:26:30,940
What's he sayin'?

365
00:26:31,372 --> 00:26:32,640
"Nessun dorma."

366
00:26:33,807 --> 00:26:35,971
"No one's sleeping."

367
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:38,207
Well, how can they
when he's shoutin' about it?

368
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,740
You blast that shit
just to annoy people?

369
00:26:41,139 --> 00:26:43,437
Is that why you hired me?
To piss that white lady off?

370
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:44,473
Yvonne?

371
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:46,139
No.

372
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,073
Then why'd you hire me?

373
00:26:51,572 --> 00:26:52,640
Can I eat now?

374
00:26:58,707 --> 00:26:59,741
What is this, uh...

375
00:27:00,139 --> 00:27:02,773
- Is this orange?
- Uh, it is a kumquat.

376
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:05,374
- A kumquat.
- Mmm.

377
00:27:14,205 --> 00:27:15,606
My fault.

378
00:27:21,138 --> 00:27:22,374
- Another one?
- Mmm.

379
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,740
You know
I can feel that, right?

380
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:45,705
God...

381
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:46,574
Okay.

382
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:51,439
No.

383
00:27:51,807 --> 00:27:54,874
No. No, I need...
I need to rest a moment.

384
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,740
Have you ever
taken care of anybody?

385
00:28:06,939 --> 00:28:07,774
Yup.

386
00:28:08,372 --> 00:28:09,407
Myself.

387
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:12,874
Hey, hey, hey, careful.

388
00:28:13,472 --> 00:28:16,705
It's a mobile. Doesn't that mean "move"?
Ain't that the point of it?

389
00:28:16,707 --> 00:28:17,807
No, it...

390
00:28:19,372 --> 00:28:21,273
- Yes, but it...
- It's expensive?

391
00:28:21,807 --> 00:28:22,707
It is.

392
00:28:24,273 --> 00:28:25,541
You as rich as Jay-Z?

393
00:28:26,907 --> 00:28:27,773
No.

394
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:29,374
Richer.

395
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:30,941
Jeez.

396
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,537
Money doesn't
buy you everything.

397
00:28:39,473 --> 00:28:41,106
Hey, look like it does to me.

398
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:44,039
Nissan Doorman now, baby.

399
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,437
- I'm Dell.
- Maggie.

400
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:47,474
The PT.

401
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,473
More like the PYT.

402
00:28:50,373 --> 00:28:52,474
Your wife okay with Victoria's
Secret dressing you?

403
00:28:54,473 --> 00:28:55,374
I'm not married.

404
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,107
You have a ring on.

405
00:29:00,373 --> 00:29:01,407
My wife died.

406
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:05,606
Shall we get started?

407
00:29:09,306 --> 00:29:11,607
Each arm,
full range of motion.

408
00:29:12,707 --> 00:29:14,207
Always both sides.

409
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,605
Any questions?

410
00:29:16,607 --> 00:29:18,538
Yeah. Have you thought about how
you're gonna tell your boyfriend

411
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,641
you met someone else?

412
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:24,139
I'll show you how to get
Mr. LaCasse ready for the day.

413
00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:26,203
If you're not too busy.

414
00:29:26,205 --> 00:29:28,406
No, me and Mags got this.

415
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,073
Get to show her
my sensitive side.

416
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:33,606
It's best viewed unclothed
and from behind...

417
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,040
by candlelight.

418
00:29:36,972 --> 00:29:38,540
Have you ever
changed a catheter?

419
00:29:40,806 --> 00:29:41,806
Nah.

420
00:29:42,372 --> 00:29:43,407
It's not hard.

421
00:29:44,238 --> 00:29:45,704
It better not be.

422
00:29:45,706 --> 00:29:47,907
Oh. Sorry,
this is your sensitive side?

423
00:29:52,273 --> 00:29:54,307
You just slowly...

424
00:29:54,872 --> 00:29:56,107
Ooh!

425
00:29:56,473 --> 00:29:57,940
- ...pull it out.
- Ooh!

426
00:29:59,272 --> 00:30:00,236
Oh...

427
00:30:00,238 --> 00:30:01,274
And the new one...

428
00:30:01,906 --> 00:30:03,437
Oh, man.

429
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:04,873
...goes right back in.

430
00:30:05,807 --> 00:30:07,374
You pinch the head...

431
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:09,970
...and insert.

432
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,474
Then you feed it in.

433
00:30:15,473 --> 00:30:16,607
I can't feel it.

434
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:18,574
Well, I can.

435
00:30:18,905 --> 00:30:20,740
Oh!

436
00:30:21,573 --> 00:30:24,307
If you can't handle this,
how are you going to...

437
00:30:28,273 --> 00:30:29,307
What's that?

438
00:30:30,406 --> 00:30:31,574
What is that supposed to be?

439
00:30:31,806 --> 00:30:32,773
You'll see.

440
00:30:33,906 --> 00:30:34,940
That's your finger?

441
00:30:36,106 --> 00:30:36,972
What, you...

442
00:30:38,806 --> 00:30:40,106
Oh, I'm not doin' that.

443
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,806
Yeah, that's not... That's not...
That's... No. There's no way. So...

444
00:30:44,706 --> 00:30:47,403
I'm not put... I'm not puttin'
my finger in nobody's butt.

445
00:30:47,405 --> 00:30:49,571
I'm not puttin' a straw
in that man's drink

446
00:30:49,573 --> 00:30:51,070
and I'm not
unpackin' his luggage.

447
00:30:51,072 --> 00:30:52,306
Well, talk to Yvonne.

448
00:30:52,906 --> 00:30:53,807
About what?

449
00:30:54,373 --> 00:30:55,973
About me not
emptying his dump truck.

450
00:30:56,306 --> 00:30:57,737
Dump truck?

451
00:30:57,739 --> 00:30:59,370
He's talking about
the bowel program.

452
00:30:59,372 --> 00:31:01,570
Oh.
Well, it's part of the job.

453
00:31:01,572 --> 00:31:03,037
It's not part of my job.

454
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,770
That's not what
a life oxillary does.

455
00:31:04,772 --> 00:31:06,537
It's what
a life auxiliary does.

456
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:08,106
Well, not this life auxiliary.

457
00:31:09,573 --> 00:31:11,271
Strike one, Mr. Scott.

458
00:31:11,273 --> 00:31:13,704
No. No, that's not a strike.
That's a check swing.

459
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,970
No, you broke the plane.

460
00:31:15,972 --> 00:31:18,137
Okay, so you the plate ump? Don't
you gotta talk to the third base ump?

461
00:31:18,139 --> 00:31:19,940
I'm every umpire. Strike one.

462
00:31:25,772 --> 00:31:27,306
Do you know about the DNR?

463
00:31:28,105 --> 00:31:28,972
D and what?

464
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:31,973
DNR. Do not resuscitate.

465
00:31:33,806 --> 00:31:35,805
It's something
you'll have to agree to.

466
00:31:36,238 --> 00:31:37,274
As my carer.

467
00:31:37,973 --> 00:31:39,407
Do you understand
what that means?

468
00:31:40,906 --> 00:31:42,637
Like, I don't have
to give you mouth-to-mouth

469
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:44,139
if you're chokin'
on your kumquat?

470
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,072
No extraordinary measures
if I stop breathing.

471
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:49,640
Nothing.

472
00:31:50,973 --> 00:31:52,406
I'm good with nothing, man.

473
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:02,073
So, you don't want to be here
no more, is that it?

474
00:32:04,405 --> 00:32:07,204
Wait, is that why you hired me
instead of those other guys?

475
00:32:07,206 --> 00:32:09,107
'Cause you thought
that I would DNR your ass?

476
00:32:11,872 --> 00:32:13,474
I'll take my lunch in my room.

477
00:32:14,772 --> 00:32:15,806
Tell Charlotte.

478
00:33:47,572 --> 00:33:48,772
What?

479
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:54,139
I was paging you.

480
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,207
This is his lifeline.

481
00:34:04,938 --> 00:34:06,373
Strike two.

482
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,540
You can't call that a strike.

483
00:34:09,373 --> 00:34:10,939
I can hear it. I see it.

484
00:34:11,372 --> 00:34:12,407
Strike two.

485
00:34:13,238 --> 00:34:14,072
Let's go.

486
00:34:14,472 --> 00:34:15,540
Now.

487
00:34:16,406 --> 00:34:17,907
Can I at least take a shower?

488
00:34:39,238 --> 00:34:40,274
Yeah.

489
00:35:04,638 --> 00:35:05,706
Yeah.

490
00:35:08,238 --> 00:35:10,605
Stop! Stop!

491
00:35:19,705 --> 00:35:20,805
Yvonne.

492
00:35:22,105 --> 00:35:23,206
Yvonne!

493
00:35:24,805 --> 00:35:25,705
Hey!

494
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,273
Alexa, stop!

495
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:38,107
- Hey.
- What?

496
00:35:38,473 --> 00:35:39,703
I'll get the shower ready.

497
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:41,407
- I want that on.
- No, man.

498
00:35:41,771 --> 00:35:43,737
Look, I get you trying
to block out the world,

499
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:45,370
but can you at least do it
to better music?

500
00:35:45,372 --> 00:35:46,972
Have you ever
listened to opera?

501
00:35:47,306 --> 00:35:49,474
Yeah.
Opera's really big in prison.

502
00:35:49,738 --> 00:35:51,440
You can hardly get a seat
on opera night.

503
00:35:52,871 --> 00:35:55,403
Why can't we listen to Aretha?
Hmm?

504
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:56,704
You wanna feed your soul?

505
00:35:56,706 --> 00:35:57,973
Then listen to its queen.

506
00:35:58,473 --> 00:36:00,107
Think about it. Yeah.

507
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:02,373
♪ You better think, think ♪

508
00:36:02,705 --> 00:36:04,971
♪ Think about what
You're trying to do to me ♪

509
00:36:04,973 --> 00:36:06,640
♪ Think, think ♪

510
00:36:07,572 --> 00:36:08,637
It's amazing, ain't it?

511
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:09,769
I sound just like her.

512
00:36:09,771 --> 00:36:11,306
Yeah.

513
00:36:11,738 --> 00:36:14,605
When I close my eyes,
which I needed to, it's uncanny.

514
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:16,439
It's like identity theft.

515
00:36:18,473 --> 00:36:20,407
- Eyes. Eye... Eyes.
- Hmm?

516
00:36:21,972 --> 00:36:23,207
Okay, okay.

517
00:36:23,572 --> 00:36:24,573
All right.

518
00:36:25,406 --> 00:36:26,739
That wasn't too bad, right?

519
00:36:27,872 --> 00:36:30,603
Okay. Okay.

520
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,106
You're waterboarding me.

521
00:36:37,772 --> 00:36:39,536
Uh... Yes file.

522
00:36:39,538 --> 00:36:41,370
You just gonna
give 'em $10,000?

523
00:36:41,372 --> 00:36:42,539
It's a nonprofit.

524
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:45,773
I ain't seen a profit
in a while either.

525
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:50,705
No, no. That's personal.

526
00:36:54,771 --> 00:36:57,407
- Hmm. Persistent.
- Throw it away.

527
00:36:58,206 --> 00:37:00,407
You don't even want to reply?
For closure?

528
00:37:05,205 --> 00:37:07,605
You have to be at the gallery
at 11:00.

529
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:13,273
That would be a no.

530
00:37:14,905 --> 00:37:15,973
Worth a shot.

531
00:37:17,771 --> 00:37:20,306
So, this how you made all your dough?
From writing this stuff?

532
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:24,273
No. I specialized in turning
around failing companies.

533
00:37:25,138 --> 00:37:26,472
Invested in start-ups.

534
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:28,706
Oh. Okay.

535
00:37:30,038 --> 00:37:32,203
So, let's say that I wanted
to start my own company

536
00:37:32,205 --> 00:37:33,805
that you was gonna
buy for a million.

537
00:37:34,571 --> 00:37:36,406
I'd say, "What is your idea?"

538
00:37:37,538 --> 00:37:38,439
I don't know.

539
00:37:39,739 --> 00:37:41,805
What are you passionate about?

540
00:37:43,306 --> 00:37:44,973
Women, sleeping.

541
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:46,940
Sleeping with women.

542
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,137
Little difficult to monetize.

543
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:51,106
I got some friends
that'd disagree with you.

544
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:54,606
Well, be that as it may,

545
00:37:55,305 --> 00:37:57,470
I suggest you find a need
and fill it.

546
00:37:57,472 --> 00:37:58,806
Philip LaCasse!

547
00:37:59,205 --> 00:38:00,569
How are you?

548
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:02,406
- God.
- Out and about.

549
00:38:03,205 --> 00:38:04,239
Good for you.

550
00:38:04,906 --> 00:38:07,204
I've been meaning to tell you,
we have found

551
00:38:07,206 --> 00:38:09,304
the most wonderful carer
for my mother.

552
00:38:09,306 --> 00:38:10,907
I'll get you the number
of the agency.

553
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:12,872
Hello.

554
00:38:13,305 --> 00:38:14,937
I'm right here. I'm caring.

555
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:17,640
- Carter, this is Mr....
- Blackman.

556
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:20,640
Daekwandashay Blackman.

557
00:38:22,273 --> 00:38:24,572
This is Carter Locke.
He lives below us.

558
00:38:25,038 --> 00:38:26,203
Oh, he's living in?

559
00:38:26,205 --> 00:38:27,406
Yes, he is.

560
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:29,703
I, uh, won't shake your hand.

561
00:38:29,705 --> 00:38:30,872
It's probably best.

562
00:38:31,438 --> 00:38:34,036
- Come on, P, we gotta bounce.
- We are bouncing, Carter.

563
00:38:34,038 --> 00:38:35,139
All right.

564
00:38:35,739 --> 00:38:37,140
That your friend?

565
00:38:37,438 --> 00:38:39,539
Get to know me, Daekwandashay.

566
00:38:40,206 --> 00:38:41,437
Which car is yours?

567
00:38:41,439 --> 00:38:42,873
All of these to the right.

568
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:46,073
All of these?

569
00:38:46,572 --> 00:38:48,405
Yes,
but we're selling them.

570
00:38:48,706 --> 00:38:50,107
Oh, my God.

571
00:38:50,472 --> 00:38:52,107
We use this van now.

572
00:38:52,771 --> 00:38:55,206
I'm not puttin' you in no paddy
wagon unless you're drunk.

573
00:38:55,605 --> 00:38:58,972
- You drunk?
- Just on your positive attitude.

574
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:00,639
You want positive?

575
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:03,372
Then I'm not puttin' you
in no big-ass negative.

576
00:39:04,106 --> 00:39:05,469
God. Damn.

577
00:39:05,471 --> 00:39:07,072
They're not practical.

578
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:09,369
Exactly.

579
00:39:13,771 --> 00:39:15,373
Whoo!

580
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:19,973
Oh, Go...
You cannot sell this car, man.

581
00:39:20,906 --> 00:39:21,772
Oh!

582
00:39:26,472 --> 00:39:27,640
The missing piece.

583
00:39:29,106 --> 00:39:30,573
- You found it.
- Hmm.

584
00:39:32,638 --> 00:39:33,539
How much?

585
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:36,104
Seventy-five. Firm, I believe.

586
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:37,540
- I can check.
- Would you?

587
00:39:40,906 --> 00:39:43,072
For 75 G's,
I could paint you a square.

588
00:39:43,571 --> 00:39:45,472
I'll throw in some rectangles
too, if you want.

589
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:49,072
Haven't you already
got this one?

590
00:39:49,371 --> 00:39:51,406
It's part of a series
my wife loved.

591
00:39:51,906 --> 00:39:53,303
Yeah,
but it's the same painting.

592
00:39:53,305 --> 00:39:55,805
Sorry, it's 80,000.

593
00:39:56,806 --> 00:39:57,706
Hmm.

594
00:39:59,105 --> 00:39:59,972
I'll take it.

595
00:40:02,972 --> 00:40:04,539
Eighty thousand dollars.

596
00:40:04,871 --> 00:40:06,637
Do you know what I could do
with $80,000?

597
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,303
Who I could do with $80,000?

598
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:12,073
Okay, but how do you put
a price on a creative work?

599
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:15,773
You pay to show
it has a value to you.

600
00:40:16,072 --> 00:40:18,772
I own a collection
of first edition novels.

601
00:40:19,105 --> 00:40:20,605
Books I read as a child.

602
00:40:22,238 --> 00:40:23,472
Signed by the authors.

603
00:40:25,238 --> 00:40:26,773
That was a gift from my wife.

604
00:40:27,772 --> 00:40:29,806
One for each year
that we were together.

605
00:40:31,438 --> 00:40:33,272
How much
would I pay for those?

606
00:40:34,906 --> 00:40:35,907
I...

607
00:40:36,705 --> 00:40:37,939
I really couldn't say.

608
00:40:52,772 --> 00:40:53,640
What?

609
00:40:53,938 --> 00:40:54,805
What?

610
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,904
Ain't gonna get me
back in there.

611
00:41:16,906 --> 00:41:18,737
I gotta get
out of here. I already...

612
00:41:18,739 --> 00:41:19,906
Yo, Latrice.

613
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:23,206
Mmm.

614
00:41:23,705 --> 00:41:25,469
- Yeah, all right.
- You okay?

615
00:41:25,471 --> 00:41:27,639
- It's all right. I'll see y'all later.
- All right.

616
00:41:28,372 --> 00:41:29,940
- Okay, girl.
- What's up?

617
00:41:31,038 --> 00:41:32,106
Whose car is this?

618
00:41:32,705 --> 00:41:33,907
It's my boss's.

619
00:41:35,571 --> 00:41:37,606
- And your boss is?
- Rich.

620
00:41:37,906 --> 00:41:40,606
Hey, I wanna see Anthony.

621
00:41:41,238 --> 00:41:43,973
Before you say anything,
Latrice, I'm working, okay?

622
00:41:44,872 --> 00:41:45,907
Here.

623
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:48,606
My first paycheck,
signed over to you.

624
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:55,569
What you doing?

625
00:41:55,571 --> 00:41:57,803
Guy I work for, he can't move,
so I gotta...

626
00:41:57,805 --> 00:42:00,639
- I gotta help him get around.
- And you make this much?

627
00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:01,904
Yeah.

628
00:42:01,906 --> 00:42:02,939
It's a good gig.

629
00:42:04,138 --> 00:42:05,770
Hope you can hang on to it.

630
00:42:05,772 --> 00:42:07,706
Course I can hang on to it.

631
00:42:10,238 --> 00:42:11,206
How's he doing?

632
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:12,939
He's good.

633
00:42:13,472 --> 00:42:15,973
Just got his report card.
All A's.

634
00:42:16,905 --> 00:42:19,072
Apple don't fall far
from the tree.

635
00:42:20,606 --> 00:42:21,907
You the tree in this story.

636
00:42:25,572 --> 00:42:26,773
Do you think, uh...

637
00:42:27,572 --> 00:42:29,873
You think maybe you could
tell him something for me?

638
00:42:33,472 --> 00:42:35,606
The book that I gave him,
I need to get it back.

639
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:37,540
Why?

640
00:42:39,471 --> 00:42:41,138
- 'Cause it...
- Wasn't yours to give.

641
00:42:42,571 --> 00:42:43,904
Trice, listen to me.

642
00:42:43,906 --> 00:42:47,302
Honey, you gave
your son a gift

643
00:42:47,304 --> 00:42:48,572
and now you want it back?

644
00:42:50,138 --> 00:42:52,907
You pry it out his hands.
I ain't doin' your dirty work.

645
00:43:06,605 --> 00:43:08,272
Yeah, that was so awesome...

646
00:43:24,272 --> 00:43:26,270
So, you're doing good
in school, huh?

647
00:43:26,272 --> 00:43:27,206
I hear about you.

648
00:43:32,605 --> 00:43:34,739
Yo, what you doing
with my kid, man?

649
00:43:35,205 --> 00:43:36,238
Shaking his hand.

650
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:37,940
What? I can't shake his hand?

651
00:43:39,571 --> 00:43:40,605
Hey, Anthony!

652
00:43:42,805 --> 00:43:43,873
Yo. Yo, yo.

653
00:43:44,772 --> 00:43:46,136
What you got going on, man?

654
00:43:46,138 --> 00:43:48,206
- Ooh! Man, you see that...
- Yo!

655
00:43:48,705 --> 00:43:49,739
Get off!

656
00:43:50,304 --> 00:43:51,569
Get off the car!

657
00:43:54,739 --> 00:43:56,139
Go ahead.
I'll watch it for you.

658
00:44:22,238 --> 00:44:23,273
Where have you been?

659
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,239
I had to run a errand.

660
00:44:29,771 --> 00:44:31,372
- Strike three.
- What?

661
00:44:31,872 --> 00:44:33,770
Come on. No, no.
That was a foul tip.

662
00:44:33,772 --> 00:44:34,873
Which I caught.

663
00:44:35,304 --> 00:44:37,639
- So, now you're out.
- Look, Yvonne, please.

664
00:44:38,238 --> 00:44:40,370
I'm serious, man.
Like, don't do this, okay?

665
00:44:40,372 --> 00:44:42,770
I had to go take my check down
to my ex. I didn't have time

666
00:44:42,772 --> 00:44:44,904
- to come back up...
- Who said you could take the car?

667
00:44:44,906 --> 00:44:45,939
I did.

668
00:44:52,572 --> 00:44:53,439
Okay.

669
00:45:01,572 --> 00:45:02,439
Thanks.

670
00:45:03,472 --> 00:45:04,373
Hmm.

671
00:45:49,104 --> 00:45:49,971
Philip?

672
00:45:51,538 --> 00:45:52,372
Philip?

673
00:45:52,872 --> 00:45:53,770
Philip!

674
00:45:55,605 --> 00:45:57,540
Tell me what to do.
What you want me to do?

675
00:45:58,606 --> 00:45:59,606
Shit.

676
00:46:00,138 --> 00:46:01,072
Come on, man.

677
00:46:01,371 --> 00:46:02,372
Is it air? It's air?

678
00:46:04,772 --> 00:46:05,972
Hold on, hold on.

679
00:46:06,906 --> 00:46:08,704
Here. Here, breathe.

680
00:46:08,706 --> 00:46:11,239
Take... Breathe.

681
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:16,406
What?
So, you not gonna breathe?

682
00:46:17,271 --> 00:46:18,640
Huh? P!

683
00:46:19,037 --> 00:46:21,206
Ain't nothing extraordinary
about breathing, man.

684
00:46:22,705 --> 00:46:24,637
P, you know damn well
I need this gig.

685
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:26,103
So, you take a deep breath

686
00:46:26,105 --> 00:46:27,573
or I am gonna give you
mouth-to-mouth.

687
00:46:35,871 --> 00:46:36,905
Here. Here, here.

688
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:49,305
That happen a lot?

689
00:46:52,872 --> 00:46:55,573
You okay, man? I mean,
does something else hurt?

690
00:46:56,471 --> 00:46:57,539
It's my legs.

691
00:46:58,938 --> 00:47:00,038
It's the nerves.

692
00:47:02,937 --> 00:47:04,939
It's called
neurogenic pain. It's...

693
00:47:06,405 --> 00:47:07,872
It's like being on fire.

694
00:47:10,238 --> 00:47:11,806
They don't give you
nothing for that?

695
00:47:14,238 --> 00:47:15,606
Different medications.

696
00:47:17,438 --> 00:47:18,605
It helps a bit.

697
00:47:21,037 --> 00:47:21,906
Not enough.

698
00:47:23,938 --> 00:47:25,905
Hurt enough to make you
wanna off yourself?

699
00:47:27,404 --> 00:47:28,273
No.

700
00:47:30,072 --> 00:47:31,806
But losing my wife does.

701
00:47:42,371 --> 00:47:43,405
I'mma help you.

702
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:16,905
It's not gonna help.

703
00:48:19,571 --> 00:48:20,905
Tell me after you try it.

704
00:48:37,305 --> 00:48:38,773
So, how did the, uh...

705
00:48:40,137 --> 00:48:41,606
How did the accident happen?

706
00:48:42,805 --> 00:48:43,939
Paragliding.

707
00:48:44,472 --> 00:48:46,439
No, no. I know that.
I'm saying...

708
00:48:47,739 --> 00:48:49,373
I'm saying how. Like...

709
00:48:51,304 --> 00:48:52,472
How did it happen?

710
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:56,804
Bad judgment.

711
00:48:57,539 --> 00:48:58,406
Mine.

712
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,971
There was some rough weather.

713
00:49:04,971 --> 00:49:06,206
We never should've...

714
00:49:07,972 --> 00:49:08,972
But...

715
00:49:09,937 --> 00:49:11,739
I've always had a, or had,

716
00:49:13,104 --> 00:49:15,072
a taste for
pushing the envelope.

717
00:49:17,071 --> 00:49:19,272
Who paraglides in the storm?

718
00:49:20,572 --> 00:49:21,605
Lightning.

719
00:49:22,104 --> 00:49:23,473
What should we do?

720
00:49:24,539 --> 00:49:27,239
I know. Let's go paragliding.

721
00:49:31,237 --> 00:49:33,205
I woke up.

722
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,039
There was Jenny.

723
00:49:38,805 --> 00:49:39,939
My poor wife.

724
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,871
And I remember thinking...

725
00:49:49,805 --> 00:49:51,106
"Well, honey...

726
00:49:52,605 --> 00:49:54,540
this should take your mind
off the cancer."

727
00:49:56,937 --> 00:49:57,971
Cancer. She...

728
00:50:00,104 --> 00:50:01,138
She had cancer.

729
00:50:02,606 --> 00:50:04,071
And, uh, I...

730
00:50:05,738 --> 00:50:06,771
I...

731
00:50:12,138 --> 00:50:13,372
Ah, sorry.

732
00:50:15,904 --> 00:50:17,572
It's nothing
to be sorry about.

733
00:50:19,737 --> 00:50:21,205
I spend a lot of mornings...

734
00:50:22,705 --> 00:50:24,273
before anyone else is up...

735
00:50:27,438 --> 00:50:31,139
before my day is a jumble
of other people's hands...

736
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,938
and I'm still flying...

737
00:50:37,205 --> 00:50:39,139
Oh, God, it took me so high.

738
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:44,106
And then it took it all away.

739
00:50:48,938 --> 00:50:50,972
But nothing compares
to losing her.

740
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:55,606
Nothing.

741
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:20,906
You feel it yet?

742
00:51:22,305 --> 00:51:24,306
I never feel anything
on this stuff.

743
00:51:25,738 --> 00:51:26,805
You'll feel it.

744
00:51:28,105 --> 00:51:29,273
Wanna bet?

745
00:51:33,605 --> 00:51:37,103
You sh... You should've bet
more than a hot dog.

746
00:51:37,105 --> 00:51:38,703
What are you talking about?
I bet...

747
00:51:38,705 --> 00:51:40,238
I bet hot dogs for life.

748
00:51:40,871 --> 00:51:43,803
Wait, no. I don't...
I don't remember that.

749
00:51:43,805 --> 00:51:44,970
We shook on it, man.

750
00:51:44,972 --> 00:51:46,735
What? You shook my hand.

751
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:48,472
You think that's gonna
hold up in court?

752
00:51:49,037 --> 00:51:51,269
Mmm. Ah, smells good.

753
00:51:51,271 --> 00:51:54,036
Um... Let me get
one recession special.

754
00:51:54,038 --> 00:51:55,071
Yeah. And for him?

755
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:58,139
Yo, man, don't do that.
Talk to him.

756
00:51:58,605 --> 00:52:00,106
Sorry. And for you?

757
00:52:01,638 --> 00:52:02,772
I want...

758
00:52:04,372 --> 00:52:08,540
fourteen hot dogs and a banana daiquiri.

759
00:52:08,905 --> 00:52:09,906
You guys high?

760
00:52:10,272 --> 00:52:12,273
Soaring.

761
00:52:12,705 --> 00:52:13,572
You got a dollar?

762
00:52:14,271 --> 00:52:15,572
- Nuh-uh.
- You got a dollar?

763
00:52:16,371 --> 00:52:17,938
All right,
would you like a hot dog?

764
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:19,569
Yeah.

765
00:52:19,571 --> 00:52:20,540
Oh, okay.

766
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,735
So, 14 hot dogs
and one hot dog.

767
00:52:22,737 --> 00:52:24,735
So, 1,500 hot dogs.

768
00:52:24,737 --> 00:52:26,402
Fifteen hundred hot dogs.

769
00:52:26,404 --> 00:52:27,802
That's what I want.

770
00:52:27,804 --> 00:52:29,638
Just gimme all your hot dogs.

771
00:52:32,405 --> 00:52:34,306
Mmm. Thanks.

772
00:52:35,138 --> 00:52:36,405
And thanks for speaking up.

773
00:52:37,471 --> 00:52:39,238
I get treated with such...

774
00:52:41,937 --> 00:52:43,038
Or I'm invisible.

775
00:52:44,138 --> 00:52:45,472
Unless they know I have money.

776
00:52:45,737 --> 00:52:47,705
Welcome to my world.

777
00:52:47,971 --> 00:52:49,438
I mean, except the money part.

778
00:52:50,204 --> 00:52:51,804
I don't have no damn money.

779
00:52:52,638 --> 00:52:54,636
I guess I gotta do me
some more, uh...

780
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:55,905
some more lateral thinking.

781
00:52:56,238 --> 00:52:59,103
- I gotta make some changes.
- Oh!

782
00:52:59,105 --> 00:53:01,139
- You've been reading my book.
- I'm trying to.

783
00:53:01,537 --> 00:53:02,804
It's kinda dry, though.

784
00:53:03,072 --> 00:53:04,803
"Dry"? It's not dry.
It's business theory.

785
00:53:04,805 --> 00:53:06,535
Well, okay.

786
00:53:06,537 --> 00:53:08,972
- My... My theory is that the book is dry.
- Dry.

787
00:53:09,238 --> 00:53:11,437
No.

788
00:53:11,439 --> 00:53:14,273
Lateral thinking is like art.

789
00:53:15,704 --> 00:53:16,906
It's another door.

790
00:53:17,537 --> 00:53:18,438
Oh...

791
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,070
Oh...

792
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,437
Are... Are you ready
to have your mind blown?

793
00:53:22,439 --> 00:53:24,235
I'm ready. I'm so ready.

794
00:53:24,237 --> 00:53:26,406
Okay, I got the idea
for my business.

795
00:53:27,472 --> 00:53:29,536
Okay, now, it's a app.

796
00:53:29,538 --> 00:53:30,703
- Okay?
- Yeah.

797
00:53:30,705 --> 00:53:33,136
It's a app that helps you find

798
00:53:33,138 --> 00:53:34,405
the closest weed.

799
00:53:37,072 --> 00:53:37,939
Hmm?

800
00:53:39,204 --> 00:53:40,639
It's called Find My Dealer.

801
00:53:41,605 --> 00:53:44,069
No, no, no. It's not that.

802
00:53:44,071 --> 00:53:47,372
It's... Take that out, okay?
It's called iDeal.

803
00:53:49,737 --> 00:53:53,105
Because of the "I" and "deal."

804
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:54,906
It's ideal.

805
00:53:55,738 --> 00:53:57,803
You see what I'm saying?
You see how it works?

806
00:53:57,805 --> 00:53:59,369
- I do.
- Right?

807
00:53:59,371 --> 00:54:01,971
But I think you need
to think some more.

808
00:54:04,304 --> 00:54:05,571
It's very niche.

809
00:54:06,638 --> 00:54:08,273
What the hell is "niche"?

810
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:11,538
It's... It's the girl version
of a nephew.

811
00:54:20,105 --> 00:54:21,735
So, was your family rich?

812
00:54:21,737 --> 00:54:23,273
Your daddy gave you
all his money?

813
00:54:24,371 --> 00:54:26,939
I earned every penny I have.

814
00:54:27,372 --> 00:54:29,872
My dad gave me nothing.

815
00:54:30,271 --> 00:54:31,871
Oh, well,
we got that in common.

816
00:54:33,237 --> 00:54:35,038
You see, my dad was a artist.

817
00:54:35,437 --> 00:54:36,438
He was?

818
00:54:37,105 --> 00:54:39,906
Con. Con artist.

819
00:54:41,204 --> 00:54:42,538
I ain't never see him, though.

820
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:46,437
Unless you wanna count the time
we spent together in lockup.

821
00:54:48,037 --> 00:54:49,472
We was in prison together.

822
00:54:49,905 --> 00:54:50,938
Sweet, right?

823
00:54:53,237 --> 00:54:55,205
You know what he said
when he saw me, man?

824
00:54:57,271 --> 00:54:58,572
He said, "Welcome home."

825
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:02,971
Can you imagine saying some
shit like that to your kid?

826
00:55:04,437 --> 00:55:05,471
"Welcome home."

827
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:10,538
I swear, my son ain't never
going to prison, man.

828
00:55:10,804 --> 00:55:11,972
Too smart.

829
00:55:13,038 --> 00:55:14,605
Boy is so smart.

830
00:55:16,037 --> 00:55:17,704
His mom, she's smart too.

831
00:55:20,304 --> 00:55:21,739
Well, you're smart, Dell.

832
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:26,105
Smart-ass.

833
00:55:26,738 --> 00:55:29,738
No. No, you're smart.

834
00:55:31,138 --> 00:55:32,205
Intelligent.

835
00:55:52,438 --> 00:55:53,906
All right, you ready?

836
00:55:54,438 --> 00:55:57,939
It's on 163rd. It's just waiting
for the million-dollar idea.

837
00:55:58,370 --> 00:55:59,471
Which you have.

838
00:56:00,205 --> 00:56:03,539
Okay. What do you think of
when I say the word "food"?

839
00:56:04,072 --> 00:56:06,872
I think,
"Don't pitch me a restaurant."

840
00:56:08,204 --> 00:56:10,704
- Forget it, man.
- What? Do you even cook?

841
00:56:10,938 --> 00:56:12,039
I could hire a cook.

842
00:56:12,605 --> 00:56:13,736
Maybe Charlotte.

843
00:56:13,738 --> 00:56:14,604
Oh?

844
00:56:15,237 --> 00:56:16,803
So, your pitch

845
00:56:16,805 --> 00:56:19,202
is that you might hire
my cook away from me?

846
00:56:19,204 --> 00:56:20,970
Forget it. Just forget it.

847
00:56:22,304 --> 00:56:23,538
You're so negative.

848
00:56:27,738 --> 00:56:30,739
Maggie says she's, uh...
she's running late.

849
00:56:31,705 --> 00:56:32,739
Okay.

850
00:56:36,905 --> 00:56:38,638
It can wait.

851
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,939
Well, it says it can't.
Says I gotta change your crazy straw.

852
00:56:42,303 --> 00:56:44,272
Why don't they have
a self-changing catheter?

853
00:56:44,937 --> 00:56:46,571
Okay. Business idea.

854
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:49,569
What if I told you that I can
create a self-changing catheter?

855
00:56:49,571 --> 00:56:51,269
I would ask

856
00:56:51,271 --> 00:56:53,273
where your biomedical
engineering degree was from.

857
00:56:54,938 --> 00:56:59,071
Look, Dell, just find
something you love doing.

858
00:57:00,805 --> 00:57:02,404
And then find a way
to scale it.

859
00:57:06,104 --> 00:57:07,769
I mean,
what are you really good at?

860
00:57:07,771 --> 00:57:09,305
Well, it's clearly not this.

861
00:57:10,037 --> 00:57:11,704
You know,
can we just not talk?

862
00:57:12,371 --> 00:57:14,903
Especially while I feel like
I'm in the worst porno ever.

863
00:57:14,905 --> 00:57:16,535
It's no big deal.

864
00:57:16,537 --> 00:57:17,804
What you mean,
"It's no big deal"?

865
00:57:18,237 --> 00:57:20,202
You ever touched
another man's, uh...

866
00:57:23,038 --> 00:57:24,572
What?
You can't even say the word?

867
00:57:25,637 --> 00:57:26,905
Yes, I can say the word.

868
00:57:27,738 --> 00:57:28,905
Well, say it.

869
00:57:29,303 --> 00:57:30,605
- No.
- Just say it.

870
00:57:30,972 --> 00:57:31,935
I don't want to.

871
00:57:31,937 --> 00:57:33,471
- Penis.
- Stop it.

872
00:57:34,303 --> 00:57:36,038
Okay, fine. Jeez.

873
00:57:37,404 --> 00:57:39,271
All right. Done.

874
00:57:39,938 --> 00:57:41,438
Young Merlin's got the sword.

875
00:57:42,104 --> 00:57:44,705
So, that would make my penis
the stone, then?

876
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:46,938
Can you stop saying that word?

877
00:57:47,271 --> 00:57:48,436
Just using your analogy.

878
00:57:48,438 --> 00:57:50,802
Stop saying the word.

879
00:57:50,804 --> 00:57:52,404
- I'm asking you.
- Okay.

880
00:57:52,704 --> 00:57:54,237
- It's not helping me.
- Okay.

881
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:57,071
All right, so,
I'll take this out.

882
00:57:59,138 --> 00:58:00,305
And then I, um...

883
00:58:01,205 --> 00:58:02,906
I gotta pinch the...
pinch the head.

884
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:06,205
Put it in. All right?

885
00:58:06,438 --> 00:58:08,369
I'm just letting you know
what's going on.

886
00:58:08,371 --> 00:58:09,772
Um...

887
00:58:10,304 --> 00:58:12,238
All right. Let's do it.

888
00:58:13,304 --> 00:58:15,138
This don't look like
it's gonna fit, man.

889
00:58:15,438 --> 00:58:16,472
That's what she said.

890
00:58:22,571 --> 00:58:23,604
All right.

891
00:58:24,471 --> 00:58:25,539
You ready?

892
00:58:26,637 --> 00:58:28,538
I'm not. I'm not ready.
Gimme a second.

893
00:58:29,404 --> 00:58:30,472
Goddamn.

894
00:58:31,104 --> 00:58:32,138
Come on, Dell.

895
00:58:34,138 --> 00:58:35,204
Shake it off, boy.

896
00:58:35,904 --> 00:58:36,804
Ha!

897
00:58:37,771 --> 00:58:40,472
Ha! Ha!

898
00:58:41,972 --> 00:58:42,871
All right, let's go.

899
00:58:43,303 --> 00:58:44,471
Coming in fast.

900
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:46,304
Grab it.

901
00:58:47,571 --> 00:58:49,039
What? Come on, man.

902
00:58:49,738 --> 00:58:50,639
Come on, man.

903
00:58:51,237 --> 00:58:52,769
What is that? What?

904
00:58:52,771 --> 00:58:54,103
You have a Cialis
for breakfast or something?

905
00:58:54,105 --> 00:58:56,135
Well, if you quit
playing with it

906
00:58:56,137 --> 00:58:57,603
- maybe it wouldn't have happened.
- Nobody's playing with it.

907
00:58:57,605 --> 00:58:58,739
Ain't nobody
playing with nothing. Go...

908
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:01,204
Make it go down.

909
00:59:01,537 --> 00:59:04,204
- Make it go down?
- Make... Make it go down.

910
00:59:04,438 --> 00:59:06,936
I'm not gonna continue with you in
this state that you're in right now.

911
00:59:06,938 --> 00:59:09,205
And wait... How do you still...
How do you even...

912
00:59:09,571 --> 00:59:11,304
It's unconscious.

913
00:59:11,904 --> 00:59:13,804
I mean, there are other ways
I can get there.

914
00:59:15,438 --> 00:59:17,105
When you're not available,
that is.

915
00:59:18,303 --> 00:59:21,368
I'll kill you. I'd DNR your ass right now.
Is that what you want?

916
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:22,938
My ears, for example.

917
00:59:23,972 --> 00:59:25,803
My ears are an erogenous zone.

918
00:59:25,805 --> 00:59:27,703
Well, I ain't touched
your damn ears.

919
00:59:27,705 --> 00:59:30,368
And I don't wanna talk about
erogenous zones right now.

920
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:32,301
Okay. Just gimme a minute.

921
00:59:32,303 --> 00:59:34,134
Come on, man.
The clock is ticking.

922
00:59:34,136 --> 00:59:35,903
- Okay.
- Come on!

923
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,769
Listen here, why don't we just
go get Yvonne, all right?

924
00:59:37,771 --> 00:59:39,468
Maybe she can find someone...

925
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:41,301
I don't think we need to talk
about Yvonne either.

926
00:59:41,303 --> 00:59:43,268
- Why?
- She's probably got a lot to do with that.

927
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:44,405
Yv... Wha...

928
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:48,269
Come on.
Yvonne is my executive.

929
00:59:48,271 --> 00:59:51,369
Oh, I forgot. Bosses are never
into their employees.

930
00:59:51,371 --> 00:59:52,903
No, that's ridiculous.
I'd have...

931
00:59:52,905 --> 00:59:54,772
Yeah, well,
your penis calls, "Bullshit."

932
00:59:55,237 --> 00:59:57,135
Boom! You wanted me to say it?
I said it.

933
00:59:57,137 --> 00:59:58,871
Penis.

934
00:59:59,937 --> 01:00:00,804
Uh...

935
01:00:05,437 --> 01:00:07,101
Uh, Yvonne, we...

936
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:09,371
we need a couple minutes more,
if you don't mind.

937
01:00:10,905 --> 01:00:12,636
Yeah. We were just
talking about you too.

938
01:00:12,638 --> 01:00:14,772
Your ears must've
been burning. Like, on fire.

939
01:00:22,438 --> 01:00:24,138
We're right here.
This us right here.

940
01:00:38,605 --> 01:00:39,638
Come on, y'all.

941
01:00:40,237 --> 01:00:42,238
Hey,
you didn't see anything, okay?

942
01:01:08,771 --> 01:01:09,605
No.

943
01:01:10,303 --> 01:01:11,471
Just stay on his ears.

944
01:01:20,605 --> 01:01:23,536
I'm telling you, P, you could
have any girl you want, man.

945
01:01:23,538 --> 01:01:25,272
You rich and you available.

946
01:01:25,804 --> 01:01:28,202
What about this lady right
here with all the Botox?

947
01:01:28,204 --> 01:01:29,871
Y'all would be perfect
for each other.

948
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:33,068
You can't move your body
and she can't move her face.

949
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:34,435
Huh?

950
01:01:41,437 --> 01:01:42,738
- How's that?
- That's good.

951
01:01:47,404 --> 01:01:49,771
- Hey, you married?
- Mm-hmm.

952
01:01:50,136 --> 01:01:51,639
- Like, how married?
- Dell.

953
01:01:52,471 --> 01:01:54,071
There's levels to marriage.

954
01:01:54,638 --> 01:01:56,635
Hey, I got it.
What if we created a app,

955
01:01:56,637 --> 01:01:58,538
like a dating app,
for billionaires?

956
01:01:58,871 --> 01:02:00,068
It already exists.

957
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:01,939
Damn.

958
01:02:07,804 --> 01:02:08,704
Mmm.

959
01:02:09,403 --> 01:02:10,372
You with him?

960
01:02:12,236 --> 01:02:13,104
Why?

961
01:02:16,637 --> 01:02:17,971
How young would you go, P?

962
01:02:18,371 --> 01:02:20,235
Dell, enough.

963
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:22,037
- What do you mean, "enough"? Just an...
- Shh!

964
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:23,471
Who you shushing?

965
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:26,638
Ain't even start singing yet.
Relax.

966
01:02:28,571 --> 01:02:29,772
How long is this show?

967
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:31,371
Three hours.

968
01:02:41,103 --> 01:02:42,137
He a tree?

969
01:02:43,071 --> 01:02:44,138
He's a singing tree?

970
01:02:45,937 --> 01:02:47,771
He's the birdman.

971
01:02:48,471 --> 01:02:49,735
He's the birdman?

972
01:02:52,071 --> 01:02:52,937
Shh!

973
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:00,639
He the birdman.

974
01:03:01,437 --> 01:03:04,102
Quiet!

975
01:03:04,104 --> 01:03:06,739
Shh!

976
01:03:07,304 --> 01:03:09,235
I'm about to throw this book
back there.

977
01:03:09,237 --> 01:03:10,402
I promise you I am.

978
01:03:10,404 --> 01:03:11,572
Sorry.

979
01:03:57,936 --> 01:03:59,204
Yeah!

980
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:01,304
Bravo!

981
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:02,739
Bravo!

982
01:04:03,137 --> 01:04:04,569
Bravo!

983
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:21,070
"'Were
not all her life but storm,

984
01:04:21,371 --> 01:04:26,372
would not painters paint a form
of such noble lines, ' I said.

985
01:04:26,903 --> 01:04:29,037
'Such a delicate high head,

986
01:04:29,704 --> 01:04:32,104
all that sternness amid charm,

987
01:04:32,704 --> 01:04:35,437
all that sweetness
amid strength?'"

988
01:04:35,805 --> 01:04:37,638
That's beautiful, Philip.

989
01:04:55,236 --> 01:04:56,271
Busted.

990
01:04:57,136 --> 01:04:59,702
- Excuse me?
- Aw, ain't no "excuse me."

991
01:04:59,704 --> 01:05:00,934
I got you good.

992
01:05:00,936 --> 01:05:02,372
Where is he? Where's he at?

993
01:05:02,604 --> 01:05:04,437
You and P, huh?

994
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:07,602
Talking 'bout your "high head"
and your "sternness."

995
01:05:07,604 --> 01:05:10,437
He's got you numbered.
That man is painting you with his words.

996
01:05:12,103 --> 01:05:13,271
Don't look at me like that.

997
01:05:13,605 --> 01:05:14,639
I heard you.

998
01:05:18,638 --> 01:05:20,102
Don't do that.

999
01:05:20,104 --> 01:05:22,772
It's his lifeline.
Remember that? Hmm?

1000
01:05:24,103 --> 01:05:25,572
How long you and P
been doin' this?

1001
01:05:26,371 --> 01:05:28,635
There is no P and me.

1002
01:05:28,637 --> 01:05:30,704
Stop it. I heard you, Yvonne.

1003
01:05:31,203 --> 01:05:33,738
And what I heard was some
Marvin Gaye-level poetry.

1004
01:05:34,371 --> 01:05:37,404
He writes letters
to a woman named Lily.

1005
01:05:40,571 --> 01:05:41,904
He dictates them to me.

1006
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,639
- Wait a minute, that's what those are?
- Yes.

1007
01:05:46,304 --> 01:05:47,705
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

1008
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:50,635
But I thought he was throwin' those away.

1009
01:05:50,637 --> 01:05:51,804
Not anymore.

1010
01:05:54,037 --> 01:05:55,071
Wait a minute.

1011
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:57,970
Wait a minute.

1012
01:05:58,437 --> 01:06:00,638
This is the part where
you say, "Thank you, Dell."

1013
01:06:01,237 --> 01:06:03,104
- What for?
- What do you mean, "What for?"

1014
01:06:03,438 --> 01:06:05,770
Why is he doing that,
Yvonne? Huh?

1015
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:07,138
It's because of me.

1016
01:06:07,638 --> 01:06:09,771
I'm the one that got him
back to his old self.

1017
01:06:10,204 --> 01:06:11,771
That's my to-do
and you know it.

1018
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:14,938
"Thank you, Dell."
"You're welcome, Yvonne."

1019
01:06:20,804 --> 01:06:22,272
Maggie said
you went to Harvard.

1020
01:06:23,637 --> 01:06:25,070
Mm-hmm. Yes.

1021
01:06:26,404 --> 01:06:28,734
So, then why you wasting
your time taking dictation?

1022
01:06:28,736 --> 01:06:30,104
I'm not wasting my time.

1023
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:32,205
How long
you been working here?

1024
01:06:32,804 --> 01:06:34,771
I used to work for him
years ago.

1025
01:06:35,605 --> 01:06:37,369
Before the accident.

1026
01:06:37,371 --> 01:06:38,934
And then I had to leave
because my mother got sick.

1027
01:06:38,936 --> 01:06:40,571
And then you came back here?

1028
01:06:41,971 --> 01:06:42,968
No.

1029
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:44,038
Then I got married.

1030
01:06:44,304 --> 01:06:46,137
And then I came back here.

1031
01:06:46,471 --> 01:06:47,871
After I heard about Philip.

1032
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:50,137
I...

1033
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:51,638
I thought I could help.

1034
01:06:52,904 --> 01:06:53,771
You're married?

1035
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,471
Was. Briefly.

1036
01:06:58,437 --> 01:07:00,536
So, now that that's over,
what are you looking for?

1037
01:07:00,538 --> 01:07:03,038
- Like, what's your type?
- I'm not looking.

1038
01:07:05,303 --> 01:07:06,304
I got your type.

1039
01:07:07,104 --> 01:07:08,468
Lumberjack.

1040
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:10,371
Lots of plaid.
Big old beard, probably.

1041
01:07:11,036 --> 01:07:13,901
One of those beards you could
lose stuff in. Where my keys at?

1042
01:07:13,903 --> 01:07:16,268
Anybody see my fishing pole?
Where my damn pole at?

1043
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:18,469
That is literally
the opposite of my type.

1044
01:07:18,471 --> 01:07:19,372
I hate beards.

1045
01:07:21,271 --> 01:07:22,472
No offense.

1046
01:07:22,803 --> 01:07:24,471
But at least you admitted
that you got a type.

1047
01:07:25,571 --> 01:07:26,938
I'm not looking, Dell.

1048
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:28,870
Mm-hmm.

1049
01:07:30,137 --> 01:07:31,304
I found a cat!

1050
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:33,605
It was in my beard.

1051
01:07:34,769 --> 01:07:36,638
Oh...

1052
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:40,638
You're tough. You're so tough.

1053
01:07:42,471 --> 01:07:43,372
Knock, knock.

1054
01:07:43,904 --> 01:07:44,937
Nope.

1055
01:07:45,203 --> 01:07:46,070
Knock, knock.

1056
01:07:47,637 --> 01:07:49,368
I will sit here
and knock all day.

1057
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:50,237
Knock, knock.

1058
01:07:51,404 --> 01:07:53,135
Who's there?

1059
01:07:53,137 --> 01:07:54,038
Yvonne.

1060
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:55,935
Yvonne, who?

1061
01:07:55,937 --> 01:07:57,472
Yvonne to make you laugh.

1062
01:08:00,637 --> 01:08:02,134
Thank you, Dell.

1063
01:08:02,136 --> 01:08:03,602
I was just warmin' up, okay?
Don't leave yet.

1064
01:08:03,604 --> 01:08:05,435
- One more. One more.
- Thank you, Dell.

1065
01:08:05,437 --> 01:08:06,803
How you make a napkin dance?

1066
01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:10,202
Put a little boogie in it.

1067
01:08:10,204 --> 01:08:11,070
Look.

1068
01:08:11,704 --> 01:08:13,235
Look.

1069
01:09:07,204 --> 01:09:09,201
- Watch out!
- Whoo-hoo!

1070
01:09:09,203 --> 01:09:10,868
Whoo!

1071
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:12,867
How did you do this?

1072
01:09:12,869 --> 01:09:14,635
What do you mean, "How did I do
this?" 'Cause I'm a genius, man.

1073
01:09:17,104 --> 01:09:19,603
"I would spread
the cloths under your feet.

1074
01:09:20,904 --> 01:09:24,037
But I, being poor,
have only my dreams.

1075
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:27,404
I have spread my dreams
under your feet.

1076
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:29,905
Tread softly

1077
01:09:31,371 --> 01:09:33,202
because you tread
on my dreams."

1078
01:09:37,438 --> 01:09:39,135
What?

1079
01:09:39,137 --> 01:09:40,538
P, I hate to break it to you,
but you ain't poor.

1080
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:43,768
I'm quoting Yeats,
a famous poet.

1081
01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:45,372
I know who she is.

1082
01:09:46,937 --> 01:09:48,871
Why don't you write Lily
your own poem?

1083
01:09:49,569 --> 01:09:52,902
Hmm?
Like, one using your words.

1084
01:09:52,904 --> 01:09:54,802
Oh, I'm... I am not a poet.

1085
01:09:54,804 --> 01:09:56,638
What you talking about?
Everybody's a poet.

1086
01:09:57,370 --> 01:09:59,971
All right. How does the
thought of her make you feel?

1087
01:10:02,037 --> 01:10:04,071
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do. Come on, man.

1088
01:10:08,071 --> 01:10:09,071
Light?

1089
01:10:09,904 --> 01:10:11,271
All right. Light as a...

1090
01:10:11,804 --> 01:10:12,704
A feather?

1091
01:10:13,603 --> 01:10:14,703
A whisper.

1092
01:10:15,471 --> 01:10:17,405
Ooh. I like that.

1093
01:10:18,904 --> 01:10:20,971
All right. What else
does she make you feel?

1094
01:10:22,271 --> 01:10:24,701
Uh...
I don't know. Brave?

1095
01:10:24,703 --> 01:10:27,070
Brave. Brave as a...

1096
01:10:27,736 --> 01:10:28,804
Doberman.

1097
01:10:30,136 --> 01:10:31,803
- Mm-mmm.
- Arrow.

1098
01:10:32,869 --> 01:10:34,138
Doberman with an arrow.

1099
01:10:35,103 --> 01:10:37,904
Uh, I... I think just "arrow."

1100
01:10:38,569 --> 01:10:40,969
How about when you see her?
What she look like?

1101
01:10:40,971 --> 01:10:42,137
Don't say, "Doberman."

1102
01:10:42,903 --> 01:10:44,971
I... I... I don't know
what she looks like.

1103
01:10:45,271 --> 01:10:46,372
What do you mean?

1104
01:10:46,737 --> 01:10:48,369
Well, it's
an epistolary relationship.

1105
01:10:48,371 --> 01:10:49,405
We just write letters.

1106
01:10:52,071 --> 01:10:53,534
Wh...

1107
01:10:53,536 --> 01:10:54,803
Well, how long
you been epistolaryin'?

1108
01:10:55,437 --> 01:10:56,305
About a year.

1109
01:10:56,737 --> 01:10:58,138
A year?

1110
01:10:58,637 --> 01:11:00,602
You been receiving these
little blue letters for a year?

1111
01:11:00,604 --> 01:11:02,405
- Yes.
- Well, I know what else is blue.

1112
01:11:03,303 --> 01:11:05,401
So, you have no idea
what this woman looks like?

1113
01:11:06,736 --> 01:11:07,803
Nor she I.

1114
01:11:08,104 --> 01:11:09,235
Yes, she does.

1115
01:11:09,237 --> 01:11:10,767
What do you mean, "Nor she I"?

1116
01:11:10,769 --> 01:11:12,538
What... What century
are you in right now?

1117
01:11:12,869 --> 01:11:15,868
Look, I don't think
you fully understand

1118
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:18,305
how an epistolary relationship
works.

1119
01:11:18,804 --> 01:11:21,604
And I don't think you
understand how a woman works.

1120
01:11:22,037 --> 01:11:23,105
She Googled you.

1121
01:11:23,704 --> 01:11:24,603
Yvonne.

1122
01:11:24,937 --> 01:11:26,372
- I'm here.
- Hey.

1123
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:29,069
- As for...
- Maggie, Maggie. Lemme ask you a question.

1124
01:11:29,071 --> 01:11:31,934
If you were Lily, would you
have Googled P's ass?

1125
01:11:31,936 --> 01:11:33,905
Or my face, perhaps?

1126
01:11:34,971 --> 01:11:36,137
Probably both.

1127
01:11:36,903 --> 01:11:38,436
What'd I tell you? Hmm?

1128
01:11:39,736 --> 01:11:41,071
Charlotte.

1129
01:11:41,437 --> 01:11:43,468
Charlotte, if you were in
an epistolary love triangle

1130
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:44,867
with an Iron Chef,

1131
01:11:44,869 --> 01:11:46,568
would you look up
a picture of him?

1132
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:48,068
First day.

1133
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:50,268
Hmm? I know
what I'm talkin' about, man.

1134
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:52,371
I wanna see what your
Google Search look like.

1135
01:11:52,869 --> 01:11:54,904
All right. LaCasse. Mmm.

1136
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:57,604
You look good, man.

1137
01:11:58,237 --> 01:11:59,704
You clean up well.

1138
01:12:00,204 --> 01:12:02,434
And I'm serious. I don't just say that.
You look real good.

1139
01:12:02,436 --> 01:12:04,134
- Wow.
- I wanna see what she look like.

1140
01:12:04,136 --> 01:12:05,138
What's her last name?

1141
01:12:07,237 --> 01:12:08,771
I'm not telling you that.

1142
01:12:10,569 --> 01:12:12,467
- No, listen... Dell.
- Stop talkin' like that.

1143
01:12:12,469 --> 01:12:13,935
- I wanna see.
- Give me the letter.

1144
01:12:13,937 --> 01:12:16,205
Foley. From Buffalo. Ooh!

1145
01:12:16,804 --> 01:12:18,138
Oh, Lily gonna be big.

1146
01:12:18,936 --> 01:12:20,301
It's cold in Buffalo.

1147
01:12:20,303 --> 01:12:21,905
She gonna be
a big, ol' flower.

1148
01:12:22,469 --> 01:12:23,404
Oh.

1149
01:12:24,137 --> 01:12:25,604
All right.
Let's search it.

1150
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:28,038
She say anything to you
about a 103rd birthday?

1151
01:12:30,437 --> 01:12:31,737
Ever mention a mug shot?

1152
01:12:32,403 --> 01:12:34,268
- Oh, God.
- All right, enough.

1153
01:12:34,270 --> 01:12:35,205
Ooh!

1154
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:37,703
This little Lily
been to market.

1155
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:39,571
A lot.

1156
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:41,437
- All right.
- Now, she cute.

1157
01:12:41,736 --> 01:12:44,767
Hello. See, but I need
more information. This how...

1158
01:12:44,769 --> 01:12:46,535
You gotta turn into, like,
a detective.

1159
01:12:46,537 --> 01:12:48,368
- Come on.
- There's nothing in there.

1160
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:50,604
- That is private, Dell.
- Just let me see if I see a clue.

1161
01:12:51,769 --> 01:12:53,737
There's a phone number
on this, man.

1162
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:55,634
So?

1163
01:12:55,636 --> 01:12:57,037
What do you mean, "So?"
Why don't you call her?

1164
01:12:57,437 --> 01:12:59,969
Because that's not
the relationship we have.

1165
01:12:59,971 --> 01:13:01,767
What you mean,
"It's not you rela..."

1166
01:13:01,769 --> 01:13:02,801
- Cut it out, man.
- No.

1167
01:13:02,803 --> 01:13:03,902
Give me the phone.

1168
01:13:03,904 --> 01:13:05,302
- No, no, no.
- Stop.

1169
01:13:05,304 --> 01:13:06,601
- Do not call her.
- It's private.

1170
01:13:06,603 --> 01:13:08,034
Please, give me the phone.

1171
01:13:08,036 --> 01:13:10,035
Yvonne,
don't grab at me like that.

1172
01:13:10,037 --> 01:13:11,738
- Don't. Don't call.
- Just give me my phone back.

1173
01:13:12,103 --> 01:13:13,367
It's ringin'.

1174
01:13:13,369 --> 01:13:14,868
- It's ringin'.
- Just hang up.

1175
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:16,367
- Give me...
- It's ringin' right now.

1176
01:13:16,369 --> 01:13:17,870
Hello,
you've reached Lily Foley.

1177
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:20,271
Please leave a message
when you hear the tone,

1178
01:13:20,536 --> 01:13:22,634
and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

1179
01:13:30,302 --> 01:13:33,403
Lily, it's Philip...

1180
01:13:35,204 --> 01:13:36,238
LaCasse.

1181
01:13:37,704 --> 01:13:38,803
And I... I just...

1182
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:41,437
wanted to hear your voice.

1183
01:13:42,303 --> 01:13:44,269
- Ask her if she work out.
- Shh!

1184
01:13:44,271 --> 01:13:46,102
Ask...

1185
01:13:46,104 --> 01:13:48,704
I was wondering
if you might return my call...

1186
01:13:49,236 --> 01:13:50,603
uh, whenever is convenient.

1187
01:13:53,636 --> 01:13:57,770
All right. Um,
I look forward to speaking.

1188
01:14:00,237 --> 01:14:01,271
Bye, now.

1189
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:05,737
That is my phone.

1190
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:07,471
That was good, man.

1191
01:14:08,104 --> 01:14:09,905
All you needed
was a little push.

1192
01:14:19,869 --> 01:14:22,368
Javik wants to do
the call on Thursday.

1193
01:14:22,370 --> 01:14:24,971
Uh, we have the benefit
on Friday.

1194
01:14:25,235 --> 01:14:26,304
And...

1195
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:28,771
you have a birthday coming up.

1196
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:35,537
What do you wanna do?

1197
01:14:37,302 --> 01:14:38,403
For your birthday?

1198
01:14:40,704 --> 01:14:41,704
Would you have...

1199
01:14:42,369 --> 01:14:43,270
Googled me?

1200
01:14:47,104 --> 01:14:48,304
I'm not sure, I...

1201
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:51,071
- I don't think so.
- Hmm.

1202
01:14:52,703 --> 01:14:54,637
- But I'm old-fashioned.
- Hmm.

1203
01:14:55,470 --> 01:14:57,304
Anyway, it shouldn't
make a difference.

1204
01:15:01,370 --> 01:15:03,467
If she's as lovely
as she seems in her letters,

1205
01:15:03,469 --> 01:15:04,703
it won't matter to her.

1206
01:15:06,303 --> 01:15:07,871
Until she sees the chair.

1207
01:15:10,604 --> 01:15:13,138
Smart women care about
what's up here and in here.

1208
01:15:13,936 --> 01:15:15,601
That's what's gonna move
the right woman.

1209
01:15:15,603 --> 01:15:17,203
Not your hands.

1210
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:21,737
Yo.

1211
01:15:22,803 --> 01:15:24,905
I need y'all to come out
in the hallway real quick.

1212
01:15:25,303 --> 01:15:27,204
- Have you been painting?
- Just come on.

1213
01:15:29,236 --> 01:15:30,300
He paints?

1214
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,204
All right. Y'all ready?

1215
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:44,236
I give you
Untitled Number Zero.

1216
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:47,905
Or What is Bravery?

1217
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:54,271
Where's the Twombly?

1218
01:15:55,037 --> 01:15:56,868
You talkin' about the one
that had the, uh,

1219
01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:58,468
the red, squiggly lines on it?

1220
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:00,968
- Yes.
- I took it down. I put it in the kitchen.

1221
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:02,370
Right next to the recycle bin.

1222
01:16:03,235 --> 01:16:04,104
Uh-huh.

1223
01:16:05,704 --> 01:16:07,105
What do you think? Come on.

1224
01:16:07,369 --> 01:16:09,704
Well, I'm not saying
I'd hang it, but...

1225
01:16:10,536 --> 01:16:13,703
- there's something...
- Something very passionate.

1226
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:16,304
Almost post-postmodern.

1227
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:18,470
I like the dog.

1228
01:16:20,302 --> 01:16:22,770
It's... unexpected.

1229
01:16:24,403 --> 01:16:26,604
And I... I say that
with admiration.

1230
01:16:28,803 --> 01:16:29,970
Who knows, man?

1231
01:16:30,302 --> 01:16:31,571
I might be the next...

1232
01:16:32,637 --> 01:16:33,803
the next Baskwat.

1233
01:16:34,604 --> 01:16:36,234
Life is crazy.

1234
01:16:36,236 --> 01:16:37,971
Charlotte,
go find the Twombly.

1235
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:43,304
- You can't be serious.
- Well...

1236
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:45,901
it may not be
your cup of tea, or mine...

1237
01:16:45,903 --> 01:16:47,538
Or even in the tea family.

1238
01:16:49,437 --> 01:16:53,470
But the important thing is to
see and encourage potential.

1239
01:16:55,302 --> 01:16:57,070
Don't you see potential here?

1240
01:17:18,369 --> 01:17:19,537
Hey.

1241
01:17:23,037 --> 01:17:24,935
Ah-ha. No.

1242
01:17:24,937 --> 01:17:26,902
I thought I could tie this
to the back of your chair,

1243
01:17:26,904 --> 01:17:28,867
put the hat on your head,
let the string hang down.

1244
01:17:28,869 --> 01:17:31,635
- Not happening.
- Come on, man. It's your birthday.

1245
01:17:31,637 --> 01:17:34,371
And I don't do birthdays, as you know.

1246
01:17:34,603 --> 01:17:36,203
But I would like
to go for a drive.

1247
01:17:36,436 --> 01:17:37,735
All right. Where to?

1248
01:17:37,737 --> 01:17:38,738
Wherever you want.

1249
01:17:40,436 --> 01:17:41,304
For true?

1250
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:42,638
For true.

1251
01:17:53,803 --> 01:17:54,871
Yo, Ant.

1252
01:17:55,737 --> 01:17:56,771
What's up, man?

1253
01:17:58,936 --> 01:18:00,770
Come on,
we gonna take you for a ride.

1254
01:18:02,536 --> 01:18:03,538
Come on, get in.

1255
01:18:05,603 --> 01:18:06,803
It's a cool car, man.

1256
01:18:15,136 --> 01:18:16,037
Hello.

1257
01:18:19,437 --> 01:18:22,200
- You his driver or something?
- Um...

1258
01:18:22,202 --> 01:18:24,103
He is my chief executive.

1259
01:18:24,736 --> 01:18:25,770
My right-hand man.

1260
01:18:27,103 --> 01:18:28,237
My left hand too.

1261
01:18:30,403 --> 01:18:32,571
All right.

1262
01:18:33,136 --> 01:18:36,868
- Playlist, Dell's Jam.
- No, no. Please, no.

1263
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:38,934
No, you don't say no
to the Queen. Come on.

1264
01:18:38,936 --> 01:18:41,803
I can see your funk soul
begging for it right now.

1265
01:18:42,136 --> 01:18:43,734
Yeah, as a matter of fact,

1266
01:18:43,736 --> 01:18:47,236
arms and hands inside
the vehicle at all times.

1267
01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:49,267
I'm watching you, P.

1268
01:18:49,269 --> 01:18:50,704
You keep them hands
where I can see 'em.

1269
01:18:51,704 --> 01:18:54,371
Look right there. Look to your left.
There goes Yankee Stadium.

1270
01:18:55,136 --> 01:18:57,436
Hey, I got a question for you.
Could you buy the Yankees?

1271
01:18:57,737 --> 01:18:59,271
Uh. No.

1272
01:18:59,570 --> 01:19:00,870
Could you buy the Mets?

1273
01:19:01,537 --> 01:19:02,371
Oh, yeah.

1274
01:19:08,135 --> 01:19:11,967
Wow, you see this?

1275
01:19:11,969 --> 01:19:15,034
That's where I schooled the world
in the fine art of the dunk.

1276
01:19:15,036 --> 01:19:16,571
You cannot dunk.

1277
01:19:17,704 --> 01:19:18,704
You never seen me.

1278
01:19:19,203 --> 01:19:20,735
Nobody's ever seen you.

1279
01:19:22,704 --> 01:19:23,970
What are we laughing at, P?

1280
01:19:24,403 --> 01:19:25,970
Um, I don't know.

1281
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:30,604
Oh.

1282
01:19:34,769 --> 01:19:36,404
- Wow! That is amazing.
- Mm-hmm.

1283
01:19:36,770 --> 01:19:38,234
We could franchise.

1284
01:19:38,236 --> 01:19:39,871
It's the best ice cream
in America, P.

1285
01:19:40,469 --> 01:19:41,404
America.

1286
01:19:45,803 --> 01:19:46,738
Dad!

1287
01:20:16,302 --> 01:20:17,537
It was nice to meet you.

1288
01:20:18,569 --> 01:20:19,403
Hey.

1289
01:20:19,969 --> 01:20:21,637
Look Mr. LaCasse
in the eye, man.

1290
01:20:23,370 --> 01:20:25,771
- It was nice to meet you.
- You too, Anthony.

1291
01:20:26,235 --> 01:20:27,804
- I'll be right back, P.
- Okay.

1292
01:20:28,236 --> 01:20:29,304
Hey.

1293
01:20:29,603 --> 01:20:31,237
- You have a good time today?
- Yeah.

1294
01:20:31,537 --> 01:20:33,702
- What'd you think about the car, though?
- Oh, it's cool.

1295
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:34,803
- It's cool, right?
- Yeah.

1296
01:20:35,103 --> 01:20:36,802
Maybe we take it out
this weekend.

1297
01:20:36,804 --> 01:20:38,702
We'll go anywhere
you want, man.

1298
01:20:38,704 --> 01:20:39,704
Okay.

1299
01:20:40,804 --> 01:20:42,237
Yo, did your mom talk to you?

1300
01:20:43,970 --> 01:20:45,136
The, um...

1301
01:20:45,636 --> 01:20:47,570
The book I gave you?
I gotta get that book back.

1302
01:20:47,803 --> 01:20:48,803
Why?

1303
01:20:49,703 --> 01:20:50,969
'Cause some stuff came up.

1304
01:20:51,603 --> 01:20:53,535
I just need you
to run up and grab it for me.

1305
01:20:53,537 --> 01:20:54,870
But weren't
you giving it to me?

1306
01:20:55,370 --> 01:20:56,603
Yeah, I was.

1307
01:20:56,903 --> 01:20:58,471
It's just a misunderstanding,
that's all.

1308
01:20:59,303 --> 01:21:00,404
Is it his book?

1309
01:21:01,136 --> 01:21:02,471
- Whose book?
- Your boss.

1310
01:21:03,804 --> 01:21:04,969
You stole it from him?

1311
01:21:07,135 --> 01:21:08,803
Anthony, listen to me.

1312
01:21:09,603 --> 01:21:10,703
Hey, Anthony!

1313
01:21:12,703 --> 01:21:14,070
I didn't know this was yours.

1314
01:21:17,769 --> 01:21:19,570
- Hey, why would you...
- Let go of me!

1315
01:21:21,769 --> 01:21:22,803
Anthony, come here.

1316
01:21:23,970 --> 01:21:25,437
Hey, come here, man.

1317
01:21:44,603 --> 01:21:46,270
It was before
you hired me, man.

1318
01:21:47,103 --> 01:21:48,403
I was gonna put it back.

1319
01:21:50,802 --> 01:21:52,069
Books are meant to be read.

1320
01:21:53,969 --> 01:21:55,303
Should've told you, though.

1321
01:21:57,135 --> 01:21:58,435
I ain't no thief.

1322
01:21:58,437 --> 01:21:59,704
I mean, I was. But...

1323
01:22:01,069 --> 01:22:02,204
I'm done with that.

1324
01:22:06,737 --> 01:22:08,237
People make mistakes.

1325
01:22:10,269 --> 01:22:11,303
I don't know.

1326
01:22:12,802 --> 01:22:14,103
I've made so many.

1327
01:22:30,102 --> 01:22:32,267
Surprise!

1328
01:22:34,536 --> 01:22:35,903
This is from my cellar.

1329
01:22:36,470 --> 01:22:37,735
Happy birthday.

1330
01:22:37,737 --> 01:22:39,300
- Happy birthday.
- Wow.

1331
01:22:39,302 --> 01:22:40,602
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

1332
01:22:40,604 --> 01:22:41,867
Thank you. Thank you.

1333
01:22:41,869 --> 01:22:43,601
Happy birthday, Philip.

1334
01:22:43,603 --> 01:22:44,538
- Happy birthday, Philip.
- Thank you very much.

1335
01:22:50,236 --> 01:22:52,866
- We should probably go out back.
- I specifically said,

1336
01:22:52,868 --> 01:22:54,933
"Nothing for my birthday."

1337
01:22:54,935 --> 01:22:56,236
I didn't... I...

1338
01:22:58,302 --> 01:23:00,934
Everybody wanted to do something
and I just thought that...

1339
01:23:00,936 --> 01:23:03,300
Yvonne, there are
very few things in my life

1340
01:23:03,302 --> 01:23:04,470
I can control.

1341
01:23:04,768 --> 01:23:06,367
And you know that.

1342
01:23:06,369 --> 01:23:08,967
My time and the people
I choose to share it with

1343
01:23:08,969 --> 01:23:10,233
are at the top of my list.

1344
01:23:10,235 --> 01:23:11,300
I know.

1345
01:23:11,302 --> 01:23:12,571
I'm sorry. I...

1346
01:23:13,936 --> 01:23:17,737
I'm gonna tell them
that they all should leave.

1347
01:23:21,736 --> 01:23:22,870
Did you know about this?

1348
01:23:23,869 --> 01:23:24,737
Huh?

1349
01:23:26,536 --> 01:23:27,570
I'm sorry, P.

1350
01:23:28,869 --> 01:23:31,403
I'm sorry you gotta have a surprise
party in your huge mansion.

1351
01:23:32,136 --> 01:23:34,937
You gotta get a bunch of expensive
gifts from your rich friends.

1352
01:23:35,269 --> 01:23:37,270
I'm sorry that you got
a thoughtful executive.

1353
01:23:38,636 --> 01:23:40,204
Some of us got real problems.

1354
01:23:40,768 --> 01:23:42,303
I'm fighting to see my son.

1355
01:23:43,569 --> 01:23:44,601
Oh.

1356
01:23:44,603 --> 01:23:45,936
I'm sorry, D.

1357
01:23:46,802 --> 01:23:48,734
Is a single afternoon
with your son

1358
01:23:48,736 --> 01:23:51,401
not enough to repair
the years of neglect?

1359
01:23:51,403 --> 01:23:53,435
- Watch your mouth, man.
- And whose fault is it

1360
01:23:53,437 --> 01:23:54,870
that you can't see him?

1361
01:23:55,637 --> 01:23:56,703
Screw you.

1362
01:23:57,303 --> 01:23:59,204
And screw
your damn privilege, man.

1363
01:24:00,537 --> 01:24:02,037
And your attitude, man.

1364
01:24:08,102 --> 01:24:09,136
Are you mad?

1365
01:24:10,537 --> 01:24:11,571
You mad, P?

1366
01:24:22,735 --> 01:24:23,969
What? You wanna break this?

1367
01:24:25,070 --> 01:24:26,869
You wanna break
Carter's bottle of wine?

1368
01:24:27,702 --> 01:24:30,134
Huh? You wanna break
this big-ass bottle of wine?

1369
01:24:30,136 --> 01:24:31,370
Yes!

1370
01:24:32,436 --> 01:24:34,736
What else you wanna do, P?

1371
01:24:37,869 --> 01:24:39,404
Hmm?
You want this, right here?

1372
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:48,534
Th... The bull.

1373
01:24:48,536 --> 01:24:49,903
I've always hated that.

1374
01:24:58,769 --> 01:24:59,870
The portrait.

1375
01:25:01,102 --> 01:25:02,470
No, no! Not that one.

1376
01:25:02,735 --> 01:25:03,769
- This one?
- No.

1377
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:05,934
- This one, right here?
- No!

1378
01:25:05,936 --> 01:25:07,567
- Which one?
- The one behind you.

1379
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:08,769
- This one?
- Yes.

1380
01:25:19,035 --> 01:25:20,069
He a relative?

1381
01:25:22,569 --> 01:25:23,600
It's...

1382
01:25:23,602 --> 01:25:24,903
It's a she.

1383
01:25:25,302 --> 01:25:27,703
Are you sure that this...
that this is a she?

1384
01:25:29,235 --> 01:25:31,637
That's Jenny's Aunt Winnie.

1385
01:25:32,636 --> 01:25:36,204
It's actually a very
flattering portrait of her too.

1386
01:25:38,769 --> 01:25:39,636
What...

1387
01:25:47,537 --> 01:25:48,636
Dell made a mess.

1388
01:25:54,236 --> 01:25:55,271
I'm sorry.

1389
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:58,736
And I'm sorry
I snapped at you.

1390
01:25:59,735 --> 01:26:00,903
You didn't deserve that.

1391
01:26:03,202 --> 01:26:05,636
Oh, it's... It's all right.

1392
01:26:12,402 --> 01:26:13,736
Oh, shit.

1393
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:16,104
Are the guests still here?

1394
01:26:20,269 --> 01:26:21,569
You ready to go party?

1395
01:26:27,035 --> 01:26:28,136
I am if you are.

1396
01:26:50,369 --> 01:26:53,204
How well do you know Dell Scott?

1397
01:26:53,903 --> 01:26:55,233
Why?

1398
01:26:55,235 --> 01:26:57,370
Well, I can
e-mail this to you.

1399
01:27:00,768 --> 01:27:02,268
No, I know about his past.

1400
01:27:02,270 --> 01:27:04,104
I'm more interested
in his present.

1401
01:27:04,403 --> 01:27:05,437
Philip, I get it.

1402
01:27:06,102 --> 01:27:07,370
Second chances.

1403
01:27:08,036 --> 01:27:10,969
But how many chances
has this man had?

1404
01:27:11,535 --> 01:27:12,869
He's done real time.

1405
01:27:13,868 --> 01:27:16,236
And you have him working
in a building we all live in.

1406
01:27:16,469 --> 01:27:17,970
Which is my right.

1407
01:27:18,568 --> 01:27:20,271
Just think about
what I'm saying.

1408
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:22,437
We all gotta live here.

1409
01:27:25,636 --> 01:27:26,904
Is this new?

1410
01:27:28,969 --> 01:27:30,037
Yes.

1411
01:27:30,469 --> 01:27:32,104
Yes, I just acquired it.

1412
01:27:32,402 --> 01:27:33,436
Who's the artist?

1413
01:27:35,103 --> 01:27:37,437
He goes by various names.

1414
01:27:38,302 --> 01:27:39,371
Is it a Banksy?

1415
01:27:39,803 --> 01:27:42,036
Oh, we don't really know,
do we?

1416
01:27:43,802 --> 01:27:45,736
You know what
the Doberman represents?

1417
01:27:46,303 --> 01:27:47,204
Well...

1418
01:27:48,868 --> 01:27:49,870
obviously.

1419
01:27:50,736 --> 01:27:52,268
Yeah, we've tried it all over.

1420
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:54,470
I mean, everybody loves it,
of course, but...

1421
01:27:55,703 --> 01:27:59,267
it has to speak to you.
It has to say, "I belong here."

1422
01:27:59,269 --> 01:28:00,137
Mmm.

1423
01:28:00,802 --> 01:28:01,702
Yeah.

1424
01:28:02,369 --> 01:28:04,770
Yeah.
We'll probably auction it.

1425
01:28:05,569 --> 01:28:07,434
I just hate
the fees they take.

1426
01:28:07,436 --> 01:28:09,233
Well, all they care about
is the money.

1427
01:28:09,235 --> 01:28:10,103
Mmm.

1428
01:28:12,535 --> 01:28:13,903
Do you think it'll appreciate?

1429
01:28:15,969 --> 01:28:18,736
I think there's no telling
what it could be worth, Carter.

1430
01:28:19,935 --> 01:28:20,903
Hmm.

1431
01:28:21,370 --> 01:28:23,068
I mean,
it's the first time...

1432
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:24,937
- Hello, Jane.
- Oh, hello, Philip.

1433
01:28:25,436 --> 01:28:26,967
Dell and I
were just talking about

1434
01:28:26,969 --> 01:28:29,037
- what it means to be black.
- Mm-hmm.

1435
01:28:29,702 --> 01:28:30,570
Ah-ha.

1436
01:28:31,602 --> 01:28:34,637
Dell,
how is that iDeal app coming?

1437
01:28:35,569 --> 01:28:36,737
You already said no to that.

1438
01:28:37,203 --> 01:28:38,734
Yes, I know I said no.

1439
01:28:38,736 --> 01:28:42,133
But I would definitely
say yes right about now.

1440
01:28:51,235 --> 01:28:52,937
Whoo!

1441
01:28:55,702 --> 01:28:56,602
- Beep beep.
- Oh!

1442
01:28:57,436 --> 01:28:58,736
- Oh!
- Oh.

1443
01:29:05,436 --> 01:29:06,703
What happened to the music?

1444
01:29:08,035 --> 01:29:10,602
Yo! Hey, soprano.

1445
01:29:11,636 --> 01:29:13,703
No, the lyric.
Not... Not the mezzo.

1446
01:29:15,236 --> 01:29:17,100
Hey.

1447
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:19,301
Can you do me a solid and sing
the Queen of the Night aria?

1448
01:29:19,303 --> 01:29:21,733
Listen, y'all don't have to
worry about nothin', okay?

1449
01:29:21,735 --> 01:29:24,634
Don't worry about none of the overtime.
Chuckles will take care of it.

1450
01:30:01,301 --> 01:30:04,867
So, you've become
an opera buff.

1451
01:30:04,869 --> 01:30:06,070
Ooh.

1452
01:30:06,368 --> 01:30:08,267
Look, man, I mean,
some of it's pretty cool.

1453
01:30:08,269 --> 01:30:09,970
- Yeah.
- It's just hard to dance to.

1454
01:30:11,235 --> 01:30:12,270
So?

1455
01:30:12,902 --> 01:30:13,969
What have you got?

1456
01:30:22,035 --> 01:30:24,802
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1457
01:30:27,602 --> 01:30:28,636
Maggie!

1458
01:30:29,702 --> 01:30:31,036
It's your chance, Maggie.

1459
01:30:31,936 --> 01:30:33,267
Ooh!

1460
01:30:33,269 --> 01:30:35,537
I've been waiting
for this. Yeah.

1461
01:30:35,768 --> 01:30:37,068
P, I'm gonna get Maggie.

1462
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:38,866
Get it, Charlotte. Get it.

1463
01:30:38,868 --> 01:30:40,703
Okay!

1464
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:43,867
You see, I got all the ladies.
Let's see if I can get the angry one up.

1465
01:30:43,869 --> 01:30:45,703
Angry Amy,
you gonna come have some fun?

1466
01:30:48,936 --> 01:30:50,070
Come on, Yvonne.

1467
01:30:50,868 --> 01:30:51,903
Come on, Yvonne.

1468
01:30:52,135 --> 01:30:55,103
- Hey, hey, hey.
- No.

1469
01:30:55,469 --> 01:30:56,734
Come on, Yvonne.

1470
01:30:58,569 --> 01:31:00,037
Come on.

1471
01:31:01,702 --> 01:31:03,569
Hey!

1472
01:31:04,536 --> 01:31:06,570
- Oh!
- What?

1473
01:31:06,869 --> 01:31:08,403
Ooh!

1474
01:31:14,202 --> 01:31:17,269
Oh, shit! Hey!

1475
01:31:18,536 --> 01:31:19,537
Wow.

1476
01:31:21,703 --> 01:31:23,236
You can really dance.

1477
01:31:23,868 --> 01:31:25,602
- No.
- You're good.

1478
01:31:25,936 --> 01:31:27,433
Come on.

1479
01:31:27,435 --> 01:31:29,434
No. Oh, God. I was always
a horrible dancer.

1480
01:31:29,436 --> 01:31:30,637
I'm actually better now.

1481
01:31:31,402 --> 01:31:34,036
This is an improvement
than what I used to do.

1482
01:31:34,936 --> 01:31:36,070
Whoo!

1483
01:31:45,568 --> 01:31:46,436
Whoo!

1484
01:31:47,102 --> 01:31:50,103
Oh!

1485
01:31:51,768 --> 01:31:52,802
Hello?

1486
01:31:56,102 --> 01:31:58,036
No, no, no.
Don't lower the music.

1487
01:31:58,803 --> 01:32:00,533
I'll call back whoever it is.

1488
01:32:00,535 --> 01:32:01,569
It's Lily.

1489
01:32:04,036 --> 01:32:04,904
Oh.

1490
01:32:07,702 --> 01:32:08,536
Lily.

1491
01:32:08,902 --> 01:32:09,936
Hello.

1492
01:32:12,103 --> 01:32:15,203
Oh. We're just having a little party.
It's my birthday.

1493
01:32:16,301 --> 01:32:19,302
It was.
And I was quite surprised.

1494
01:32:23,102 --> 01:32:23,970
Oh?

1495
01:32:26,736 --> 01:32:28,970
Well, let me...
Let me see if I...

1496
01:32:29,702 --> 01:32:32,435
Do you think
I have Saturday free?

1497
01:32:32,903 --> 01:32:33,770
Um...

1498
01:32:34,568 --> 01:32:35,436
Mm-hmm.

1499
01:32:36,436 --> 01:32:39,403
Yes, I think
that will work just fine.

1500
01:32:39,803 --> 01:32:41,203
I... I'll see you then.

1501
01:32:42,868 --> 01:32:44,466
Okay.

1502
01:32:44,468 --> 01:32:45,369
Okay.

1503
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:47,870
Goodbye.

1504
01:33:01,435 --> 01:33:02,303
Wow.

1505
01:33:14,069 --> 01:33:16,569
Y... You don't think
that I should tell her?

1506
01:33:17,368 --> 01:33:18,469
About the chair?

1507
01:33:19,902 --> 01:33:22,402
I think you should focus on what
this woman may not have told you.

1508
01:33:24,602 --> 01:33:26,602
God, it's been
so long since...

1509
01:33:27,635 --> 01:33:28,702
I...

1510
01:33:30,401 --> 01:33:31,802
I don't even know
what to wear.

1511
01:33:32,435 --> 01:33:33,870
I'll tell you
what not to wear.

1512
01:33:37,234 --> 01:33:39,302
- Really?
- Yeah, not on a date.

1513
01:33:39,802 --> 01:33:41,433
Well, I...
I wouldn't call this a...

1514
01:33:41,435 --> 01:33:42,570
It's a date.

1515
01:33:47,569 --> 01:33:48,602
Happy birthday, man.

1516
01:33:50,368 --> 01:33:51,236
Thanks.

1517
01:34:00,102 --> 01:34:00,970
You ready?

1518
01:34:01,869 --> 01:34:02,737
Yeah.

1519
01:34:03,469 --> 01:34:05,703
All right,
the safe word is gonna be...

1520
01:34:06,269 --> 01:34:07,270
"Verdi."

1521
01:34:08,935 --> 01:34:11,567
I'm supposed to drop "Verdi"
into a sentence?

1522
01:34:11,569 --> 01:34:13,034
- Yes.
- Huh.

1523
01:34:13,036 --> 01:34:16,703
Like, "I gotta go.
You are Verdi ugly."

1524
01:34:28,735 --> 01:34:31,068
I can see you mentally
tapping your leg, man.

1525
01:34:32,302 --> 01:34:33,736
Relax, P. She gonna be here.

1526
01:34:38,034 --> 01:34:39,103
Dell.

1527
01:34:40,303 --> 01:34:42,370
Reach into my jacket pocket.
There should be an envelope.

1528
01:34:48,803 --> 01:34:49,870
Open it.

1529
01:34:59,369 --> 01:35:00,303
Well, uh...

1530
01:35:01,102 --> 01:35:03,367
That is for
Untitled Number Zero,

1531
01:35:03,369 --> 01:35:05,136
or What is Bravery?

1532
01:35:05,970 --> 01:35:09,203
which is now proudly hung
in Carter's trophy room.

1533
01:35:11,268 --> 01:35:13,068
- For real?
- For real.

1534
01:35:13,435 --> 01:35:14,968
- For keeps?
- For keeps.

1535
01:35:14,970 --> 01:35:16,135
For put it on your mama?

1536
01:35:17,235 --> 01:35:18,601
"Put it on your mama"?

1537
01:35:18,603 --> 01:35:19,737
Yo, P, this is...

1538
01:35:22,202 --> 01:35:23,470
This is crazy, man.

1539
01:35:24,402 --> 01:35:25,937
Hell, yeah, man!

1540
01:35:26,703 --> 01:35:29,600
Hell yeah, P! Hell ye...

1541
01:35:29,602 --> 01:35:30,903
That's my bad. My bad, man.

1542
01:35:31,569 --> 01:35:32,603
That's me. My fault.

1543
01:35:34,035 --> 01:35:35,770
Yo, P!

1544
01:35:37,035 --> 01:35:38,469
This is it.
This is my business.

1545
01:35:39,034 --> 01:35:39,936
I'm a artist.

1546
01:35:40,936 --> 01:35:42,734
I can crank these suckers out
once a month.

1547
01:35:42,736 --> 01:35:45,400
Fifty grand a pop. Over the
course of a year, that'd be...

1548
01:35:45,402 --> 01:35:46,435
Fifty grand.

1549
01:35:46,968 --> 01:35:48,966
That'd be 50 grand. Total.

1550
01:35:48,968 --> 01:35:51,700
No, Dell. This is not
your business, Dell.

1551
01:35:51,702 --> 01:35:54,400
- Wait, wait, but listen...
- Dell, no. This is seed money

1552
01:35:54,402 --> 01:35:56,068
for the business
you do come up with.

1553
01:36:03,402 --> 01:36:04,269
What?

1554
01:36:05,035 --> 01:36:06,036
Is she here?

1555
01:36:06,735 --> 01:36:07,903
I hope so.

1556
01:36:09,869 --> 01:36:10,904
Hello, Philip.

1557
01:36:12,769 --> 01:36:13,766
Hello.

1558
01:36:16,402 --> 01:36:17,769
Oh, I'm sorry, um...

1559
01:36:18,369 --> 01:36:19,966
- This is Dell.
- Oh, my bad.

1560
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:21,866
- He... He'll be joining us...
- Hello.

1561
01:36:21,868 --> 01:36:23,068
- ...since, uh...
- What's up?

1562
01:36:24,034 --> 01:36:25,068
Since...

1563
01:36:27,369 --> 01:36:28,602
I meant to tell you.

1564
01:36:30,034 --> 01:36:31,068
I knew.

1565
01:36:31,768 --> 01:36:32,935
I saw a photo.

1566
01:36:33,869 --> 01:36:35,770
I read an article.
I had to. Your...

1567
01:36:36,768 --> 01:36:38,736
Your letters were too good.

1568
01:36:40,369 --> 01:36:41,637
Uh...

1569
01:36:41,935 --> 01:36:43,770
You don't have to stay,
we're... we're fine.

1570
01:36:45,102 --> 01:36:46,136
Uh-huh.

1571
01:36:48,702 --> 01:36:49,570
Uh...

1572
01:36:49,935 --> 01:36:50,968
Okay.

1573
01:36:51,703 --> 01:36:53,966
Just, uh... Just have my guy
back by midnight.

1574
01:36:56,202 --> 01:36:57,636
Midnight tomorrow
at the latest.

1575
01:36:58,369 --> 01:36:59,469
- Okay.
- Be good, man.

1576
01:37:00,969 --> 01:37:02,036
This is...

1577
01:37:03,635 --> 01:37:06,135
Well, it's your city.
You make the best of it.

1578
01:37:06,402 --> 01:37:07,436
Well, that's true.

1579
01:37:07,935 --> 01:37:08,968
Always interesting.

1580
01:37:09,269 --> 01:37:10,302
I'm never bored there.

1581
01:37:11,368 --> 01:37:14,969
We're both talking about
Buffalo, New York, right?

1582
01:37:15,435 --> 01:37:17,067
- It's a beautiful city.
- Okay.

1583
01:37:17,069 --> 01:37:19,534
And the library I run
is a national treasure.

1584
01:37:19,536 --> 01:37:21,566
Oh, and we did
just beat your Giants.

1585
01:37:21,568 --> 01:37:23,967
Oh. I see.

1586
01:37:23,969 --> 01:37:26,103
A football fan. You know,
that wasn't mentioned.

1587
01:37:26,802 --> 01:37:28,802
- Well, I couldn't tell you everything.
- Mm-hmm.

1588
01:37:30,768 --> 01:37:32,601
- The food here is brilliant, isn't it?
- Mmm.

1589
01:37:32,603 --> 01:37:34,566
Although I hear
Buffalo has great wings.

1590
01:37:37,135 --> 01:37:38,203
Oh, you...

1591
01:37:38,603 --> 01:37:40,069
- you have something...
- Oh.

1592
01:37:41,301 --> 01:37:42,400
There?

1593
01:37:42,402 --> 01:37:43,436
No.

1594
01:37:43,702 --> 01:37:44,933
- It's right there.
- Oh.

1595
01:37:44,935 --> 01:37:45,865
Show-off.

1596
01:37:45,867 --> 01:37:47,100
Oh. Would, um...

1597
01:37:47,102 --> 01:37:48,737
- Would you like me to...
- No, no.

1598
01:37:51,469 --> 01:37:52,936
I'm usually
pretty good at this.

1599
01:37:57,703 --> 01:37:59,136
- Gone.
- Good.

1600
01:38:02,602 --> 01:38:03,470
Ooh.

1601
01:38:04,068 --> 01:38:05,436
Oh, that looks beautiful.

1602
01:38:05,968 --> 01:38:06,868
Thank you.

1603
01:38:07,602 --> 01:38:11,099
So, tell me about your day.
Any day.

1604
01:38:11,101 --> 01:38:12,534
Yesterday.

1605
01:38:12,536 --> 01:38:14,132
- I wanna know everything.
- Yesterday...

1606
01:38:14,134 --> 01:38:15,270
- Yeah.
- Ah.

1607
01:38:15,901 --> 01:38:18,800
I skipped some meetings
to sit in on story hour.

1608
01:38:18,802 --> 01:38:20,537
- Mmm.
- Do you know The Missing Piece?

1609
01:38:21,368 --> 01:38:22,536
By Shel Silverstein?

1610
01:38:23,035 --> 01:38:24,469
- Point to you.
- Oh, well...

1611
01:38:25,034 --> 01:38:27,601
No, honestly, you should
take the point back.

1612
01:38:27,603 --> 01:38:28,734
I never read it.

1613
01:38:29,703 --> 01:38:31,100
Well, it's about a circle

1614
01:38:31,102 --> 01:38:32,966
that's missing
this pie-shaped piece.

1615
01:38:32,968 --> 01:38:34,701
And it goes on
a search for it.

1616
01:38:34,703 --> 01:38:38,600
It tries big pieces,
small pieces, broken pieces,

1617
01:38:38,602 --> 01:38:40,202
but none of them
let it roll right.

1618
01:38:40,568 --> 01:38:41,602
And then, one day...

1619
01:38:42,468 --> 01:38:43,537
there it is.

1620
01:38:43,902 --> 01:38:44,936
The perfect piece.

1621
01:38:46,136 --> 01:38:52,701
It picks it up and suddenly
it can go faster and faster.

1622
01:38:52,703 --> 01:38:53,737
It's free.

1623
01:38:57,603 --> 01:39:00,367
But after a while it realizes,

1624
01:39:00,369 --> 01:39:03,066
now it can't sing

1625
01:39:03,068 --> 01:39:06,536
or smell the flowers
or talk to its friends.

1626
01:39:07,702 --> 01:39:09,069
It was going too fast.

1627
01:39:15,034 --> 01:39:18,102
And in the end it decides to
leave the perfect piece behind.

1628
01:39:19,402 --> 01:39:22,634
Ooh. That's pretty deep,
for a children's book.

1629
01:39:22,636 --> 01:39:24,203
It is, isn't it?

1630
01:39:25,635 --> 01:39:27,099
They can be scary, though.

1631
01:39:27,101 --> 01:39:30,033
I remember reading
Grimm's Fairy Tales

1632
01:39:30,035 --> 01:39:32,602
and it frightened me as a boy.

1633
01:39:37,269 --> 01:39:38,969
Do I... Do I have something?

1634
01:39:39,369 --> 01:39:40,434
- What? No.
- Did...

1635
01:39:40,436 --> 01:39:41,969
Sorry.

1636
01:39:44,369 --> 01:39:45,936
Oh, yes, please. Thank you.

1637
01:39:55,069 --> 01:39:56,103
How are your dogs?

1638
01:39:57,401 --> 01:40:00,068
Oh, they're fine.

1639
01:40:05,402 --> 01:40:06,436
So...

1640
01:40:08,569 --> 01:40:10,036
is this what you expected?

1641
01:40:11,535 --> 01:40:12,569
In what way?

1642
01:40:16,636 --> 01:40:17,868
Just, you know...

1643
01:40:19,968 --> 01:40:22,202
is it what you expected?

1644
01:40:25,902 --> 01:40:26,935
My therapist said...

1645
01:40:30,636 --> 01:40:33,637
I swore I would never start a sentence
with those words, but, right...

1646
01:40:38,302 --> 01:40:39,370
I think...

1647
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:42,035
what's happening here...

1648
01:40:43,902 --> 01:40:45,433
is that this is what
she expected,

1649
01:40:45,435 --> 01:40:46,303
not what I did.

1650
01:40:48,234 --> 01:40:49,402
I thought I could...

1651
01:40:50,102 --> 01:40:52,136
I mean, I knew that I could...

1652
01:40:55,035 --> 01:40:57,099
I read up quite a bit.

1653
01:40:57,101 --> 01:40:58,902
I... I talked to people.

1654
01:41:00,901 --> 01:41:02,470
The librarian
did her homework.

1655
01:41:06,801 --> 01:41:10,102
To answer your question,
and it is a fair question,

1656
01:41:11,469 --> 01:41:12,869
it's not what I expected.

1657
01:41:14,069 --> 01:41:15,069
It's a lot.

1658
01:41:16,269 --> 01:41:19,603
I mean... What I mean is that
maybe Dell should have stayed.

1659
01:41:20,603 --> 01:41:21,635
To help.

1660
01:41:22,235 --> 01:41:25,299
You have to walk
before you can run, right?

1661
01:41:25,301 --> 01:41:28,233
No. Oh. That was completely
the wrong thing to say.

1662
01:41:28,235 --> 01:41:29,103
I...

1663
01:41:30,035 --> 01:41:31,736
I need to stop talking.

1664
01:41:35,102 --> 01:41:36,103
No, thank you.

1665
01:41:39,068 --> 01:41:41,102
I'm... I'm tired.

1666
01:41:42,202 --> 01:41:44,599
This is part of...

1667
01:41:44,601 --> 01:41:46,599
You may have read about it.

1668
01:41:46,601 --> 01:41:48,899
- Oh, no, please don't.
- I think perhaps you should call Dell.

1669
01:41:48,901 --> 01:41:50,599
But the next course
is supposed to be the best...

1670
01:41:50,601 --> 01:41:52,435
No. I'd... I'd like to leave.

1671
01:41:55,734 --> 01:41:57,266
I shouldn't
have been so honest.

1672
01:41:57,268 --> 01:41:59,701
No. I'm glad that you were.

1673
01:42:03,868 --> 01:42:07,067
- I would like to be friends, if we...
- Please.

1674
01:42:07,069 --> 01:42:09,270
- I don't want you to think that...
- No, just don't.

1675
01:42:10,134 --> 01:42:11,699
Oh!

1676
01:42:11,701 --> 01:42:12,769
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry.

1677
01:42:15,634 --> 01:42:18,269
Oh, my God, did I burn you?

1678
01:42:19,102 --> 01:42:21,866
- Did it burn you, sir?
- It's all right. Don't. Please, don't.

1679
01:42:21,868 --> 01:42:24,069
I don't...
I can't feel anything.

1680
01:42:24,767 --> 01:42:25,933
Apologies, sir.

1681
01:42:25,935 --> 01:42:27,136
I don't feel anything.

1682
01:43:00,134 --> 01:43:01,469
You know what, P?

1683
01:43:02,867 --> 01:43:04,569
- That's her loss, man.
- Don't.

1684
01:43:06,568 --> 01:43:08,802
- What do you mean, "Don't"?
- Don't patronize me.

1685
01:43:10,767 --> 01:43:13,269
This is exactly why
I didn't wanna speak to her.

1686
01:43:16,634 --> 01:43:18,735
You, uh...
You need anything else?

1687
01:43:19,635 --> 01:43:20,736
Oh, are we done?

1688
01:43:21,936 --> 01:43:24,270
You don't wanna have this
conversation, so we're done?

1689
01:43:25,234 --> 01:43:27,768
P, do you know how many times
I've been rejected by women?

1690
01:43:28,302 --> 01:43:29,900
It happens, all right?

1691
01:43:29,902 --> 01:43:31,533
You fall off the horse,
you get up, get back on.

1692
01:43:31,535 --> 01:43:33,436
Yeah, but I can't
ride a horse, so...

1693
01:43:34,101 --> 01:43:35,202
Here we go.

1694
01:43:35,735 --> 01:43:36,769
You know what?

1695
01:43:37,235 --> 01:43:38,802
This... This isn't working.

1696
01:43:39,802 --> 01:43:42,470
- You're tired, man.
- Yeah, I'm tired. I'm tired of this.

1697
01:43:43,101 --> 01:43:44,370
I never should've hired you.

1698
01:43:45,534 --> 01:43:47,865
You're the least
qualified applicant

1699
01:43:47,867 --> 01:43:49,300
by a factor of 100.

1700
01:43:49,302 --> 01:43:50,436
- Really?
- Yeah.

1701
01:43:51,667 --> 01:43:54,067
What? You want me to go back
and get one of those eggheads?

1702
01:43:54,069 --> 01:43:55,569
'Cause I'm still here,
aren't I?

1703
01:43:55,902 --> 01:43:57,602
I think I was
the most qualified.

1704
01:43:58,467 --> 01:44:01,869
I can't believe that you
talked me into seeing her.

1705
01:44:02,567 --> 01:44:03,801
I called her.

1706
01:44:04,369 --> 01:44:06,699
- That's it. That's all I did.
- Mm-hmm.

1707
01:44:06,701 --> 01:44:09,369
I was gonna hang up the phone.
You chose to speak to her.

1708
01:44:09,867 --> 01:44:11,369
I didn't hold a gun
up to your head.

1709
01:44:11,602 --> 01:44:13,133
Oh. Well, although,

1710
01:44:13,135 --> 01:44:14,932
I gather you've had some
experience doing that.

1711
01:44:14,934 --> 01:44:16,402
Given your
concealed weapon charge.

1712
01:44:17,968 --> 01:44:20,266
- So, we're going back to my record, now?
- You know what?

1713
01:44:20,268 --> 01:44:23,865
I wanted to engage Lily
on my terms.

1714
01:44:23,867 --> 01:44:25,102
And you took that from me.

1715
01:44:25,534 --> 01:44:28,202
I took it?
'Cause I'm a thief, right?

1716
01:44:29,201 --> 01:44:30,235
Well, aren't you?

1717
01:44:31,034 --> 01:44:33,102
You know, that's my past
and I will own that.

1718
01:44:33,602 --> 01:44:35,869
I got no problem with that.
But I'm moving forward.

1719
01:44:36,135 --> 01:44:38,966
- What about you, P? Hmm?
- Yeah, I'm moving forward too.

1720
01:44:38,968 --> 01:44:40,035
- Are you?
- Yeah.

1721
01:44:40,734 --> 01:44:41,736
With this.

1722
01:44:42,268 --> 01:44:43,769
Get out. You're fired.

1723
01:44:45,702 --> 01:44:46,865
I'm what?

1724
01:44:46,867 --> 01:44:48,769
I'm letting you go. All right?

1725
01:45:08,701 --> 01:45:11,601
Defense, man. Defense.

1726
01:45:16,867 --> 01:45:17,735
Yo.

1727
01:45:18,735 --> 01:45:19,936
Welcome home, man.

1728
01:45:49,401 --> 01:45:50,402
Philip.

1729
01:45:51,801 --> 01:45:52,868
This is Jason.

1730
01:45:54,468 --> 01:45:56,203
He's gonna be your new carer.

1731
01:46:11,135 --> 01:46:12,702
Food, Mr. LaCasse?

1732
01:46:53,035 --> 01:46:53,936
Wow.

1733
01:47:29,368 --> 01:47:30,402
It's nice.

1734
01:47:30,801 --> 01:47:31,701
Big.

1735
01:47:33,735 --> 01:47:35,236
Aren't you gonna come inside?

1736
01:47:36,602 --> 01:47:37,636
Not right now.

1737
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,702
I'll see you tomorrow, though.

1738
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:41,802
I'll pick you up from school.

1739
01:47:42,267 --> 01:47:43,935
If that's okay.

1740
01:47:46,634 --> 01:47:47,569
Cool.

1741
01:48:18,301 --> 01:48:21,466
Hey, Dell. I need you
to check on the new guy.

1742
01:48:21,468 --> 01:48:22,736
Okay, I'm on it.

1743
01:48:28,233 --> 01:48:30,701
Make sure you turn
the supports inward, okay?

1744
01:48:31,267 --> 01:48:33,068
That way,
they cradle the patient's arm.

1745
01:48:33,634 --> 01:48:34,468
Exactly.

1746
01:48:34,901 --> 01:48:36,234
How fast do they go?

1747
01:48:36,868 --> 01:48:39,369
You'd be surprised.

1748
01:48:47,367 --> 01:48:48,636
He's bad, Dell.

1749
01:48:49,601 --> 01:48:52,568
He won't listen to anyone.
He might listen to you.

1750
01:48:53,868 --> 01:48:54,936
Where's Yvonne?

1751
01:48:55,268 --> 01:48:56,434
She left.

1752
01:48:57,301 --> 01:48:58,468
Yvonne left?

1753
01:48:59,568 --> 01:49:01,136
He's pushing everybody away.

1754
01:49:10,901 --> 01:49:11,769
You all set?

1755
01:49:13,401 --> 01:49:14,434
Okay, cool.

1756
01:49:36,134 --> 01:49:38,402
Some animal has collapsed
on your face, Phil.

1757
01:49:39,801 --> 01:49:41,600
I don't know
if you can feel it,

1758
01:49:41,602 --> 01:49:43,202
but I'm gonna try
and move 'em.

1759
01:49:44,069 --> 01:49:45,702
I just need you to hold still.

1760
01:49:51,068 --> 01:49:52,569
Oh, no, that's a beard.

1761
01:49:53,902 --> 01:49:55,102
This is intentional?

1762
01:50:00,635 --> 01:50:01,935
You wanna go for a drive?

1763
01:50:38,468 --> 01:50:39,800
All right.
So, we radioed ahead.

1764
01:50:39,802 --> 01:50:41,366
They're comin' out
with a gurney.

1765
01:50:41,368 --> 01:50:43,199
- He's gonna be fine.
- Appreciate you, man.

1766
01:50:49,534 --> 01:50:50,434
What now?

1767
01:50:52,701 --> 01:50:54,535
- Oh, shit.
- Go, go, go!

1768
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:23,568
Pretty enough to paint?

1769
01:51:26,868 --> 01:51:29,469
I could see if Carter's
interested in a commission.

1770
01:51:35,702 --> 01:51:38,035
Playlist, Phil's Jam.

1771
01:51:42,634 --> 01:51:45,132
- No, come on, P. No, I'm serious, man.
- No. Just...

1772
01:51:45,134 --> 01:51:46,932
- I'm not in the mood to hear it.
- ...give it a moment.

1773
01:51:46,934 --> 01:51:49,301
- I'm not in the mood, though.
- Just give it a moment.

1774
01:51:59,367 --> 01:52:00,468
Wait, who is this?

1775
01:52:01,534 --> 01:52:02,735
That's the queen.

1776
01:52:03,401 --> 01:52:06,101
My queen? That's Aretha?

1777
01:52:06,702 --> 01:52:07,602
Mm-hmm.

1778
01:52:08,668 --> 01:52:10,636
She filled in for Pavarotti
once at the Grammys.

1779
01:52:14,635 --> 01:52:16,801
- Queen make everything better.
- Mm-hmm.

1780
01:52:34,867 --> 01:52:36,768
Ah. It's lovely.

1781
01:52:38,535 --> 01:52:39,766
Mmm.

1782
01:52:43,268 --> 01:52:44,369
You must be Philip.

1783
01:52:45,234 --> 01:52:46,601
- Yes.
- You ready?

1784
01:52:47,602 --> 01:52:48,536
Ready?

1785
01:52:50,267 --> 01:52:51,934
What did you do?

1786
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:04,068
You Dell?

1787
01:53:06,401 --> 01:53:07,268
No.

1788
01:53:07,868 --> 01:53:09,301
Yes, he is!

1789
01:53:09,801 --> 01:53:12,101
No. No, I'm not.
I'm doing that, man.

1790
01:53:12,435 --> 01:53:14,435
What you...
You trying to kill me?

1791
01:53:14,768 --> 01:53:16,733

1792
01:53:16,735 --> 01:53:18,636
I'm not doing that, P. No.

1793
01:53:24,034 --> 01:53:26,368
- Keep going. Keep going.
- Whoo!

1794
01:53:29,435 --> 01:53:31,068
Whoo-hoo!

1795
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:34,866
Yeah. Hey, man, I... I'm not gonna do it.

1796
01:53:34,868 --> 01:53:36,902
- We got this.
- Nah. No, we don't.

1797
01:53:37,134 --> 01:53:39,800
Keep running, Dell!
Keep running, Dell! Run, Dell!

1798
01:53:39,802 --> 01:53:42,365
Run, Dell! Run, run!
Keep running, Dell!

1799
01:53:42,367 --> 01:53:44,198
- Whoa!
- Come on, Dell!

1800
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:46,901
Come on, Dell. Go like this...

1801
01:53:48,034 --> 01:53:50,031
- You can let go. Grab those handles.
- Oh, shit!

1802
01:53:50,033 --> 01:53:52,701
- Oh! Whoa!
- We're looking good.

1803
01:53:53,234 --> 01:53:54,102
Good.

1804
01:53:54,635 --> 01:53:56,068
Yo, control it, man!

1805
01:53:56,802 --> 01:53:57,736
Control it!

1806
01:54:00,535 --> 01:54:01,469
Hey, Dell!

1807
01:54:03,635 --> 01:54:05,068
Just relax!

1808
01:54:05,701 --> 01:54:07,101
I am relaxed!

1809
01:54:07,568 --> 01:54:09,032
This is me being relaxed!

1810
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:29,068
Dell.

1811
01:54:30,068 --> 01:54:31,435
Thank you!

1812
01:54:33,534 --> 01:54:35,134
How are you doing?

1813
01:54:35,535 --> 01:54:37,269
Yo, it's amazing, man!

1814
01:54:39,468 --> 01:54:41,235
I can't believe I'm flying!

1815
01:54:44,768 --> 01:54:46,769
Whoo!

1816
01:54:47,734 --> 01:54:51,601
Yeah!

1817
01:54:55,801 --> 01:54:56,868
Thank you.

1818
01:54:57,134 --> 01:54:59,435
Oh, man, look at this.

1819
01:55:00,301 --> 01:55:02,801
- Ooh!
- Oh, yeah, that's pretty.

1820
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:05,601
Oh, God.

1821
01:55:08,635 --> 01:55:09,536
Hey,

1822
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:11,535
it's time to let the beard go.

1823
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:13,068
Why?

1824
01:55:13,702 --> 01:55:15,068
Just trust me on this one.

1825
01:55:22,601 --> 01:55:23,469
Talk to me.

1826
01:55:23,768 --> 01:55:25,131
Talk to me.

1827
01:55:25,133 --> 01:55:26,465
I look... I look like a...

1828
01:55:26,467 --> 01:55:27,568
A porn star.

1829
01:55:28,068 --> 01:55:29,799
- Oh, that's the one.
- Let me see.

1830
01:55:29,801 --> 01:55:31,902
- Oh, this is the one right here.
- Let me see.

1831
01:55:35,801 --> 01:55:37,466
- That's the one.
- I'm badass!

1832
01:55:37,468 --> 01:55:39,468
Yeah, I was tired of you
looking like a bitch.

1833
01:55:39,766 --> 01:55:42,132
- No. No, that's not it.
- Hello, there.

1834
01:55:42,134 --> 01:55:43,736
- I know what to do. Lemme see.
- I'm very...

1835
01:55:44,133 --> 01:55:45,366
Is it Chaplin?

1836
01:55:45,368 --> 01:55:46,298
No.

1837
01:55:46,300 --> 01:55:47,298
It's Charlie Chaplin.

1838
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:48,468
No, no, no!

1839
01:55:54,601 --> 01:55:56,201
Oh, that is terrible.

1840
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:00,864
- Oh, there he is.
- Yeah.

1841
01:56:00,866 --> 01:56:02,433
- Who's that guy?
- I don't know.

1842
01:56:02,435 --> 01:56:03,768
I haven't seen him in a while.

1843
01:56:07,033 --> 01:56:08,700
Oh!

1844
01:56:08,702 --> 01:56:10,131
- Thanks for the warning.
- I'm sorry I didn't see it.

1845
01:56:14,034 --> 01:56:16,098
All right. How you feeling, P?

1846
01:56:16,100 --> 01:56:16,968
Good.

1847
01:56:17,268 --> 01:56:18,801
Very good.

1848
01:56:19,934 --> 01:56:22,469
Well, hold on, 'cause the best
is yet to come.

1849
01:56:56,635 --> 01:56:57,701
Hi.

1850
01:57:01,701 --> 01:57:02,569
Hi.

1851
01:57:07,901 --> 01:57:09,369
I missed you.
